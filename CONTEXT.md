# Portfolio Domain Context & Glossary

## Delivery Coordination & Issue Governance

- **Governing Map**: A non-executable epic or specification that defines a workstream's boundaries, outcomes, and child tickets. A governing map is not part of the agent work frontier and remains open until its child outcomes are complete.
- **Executable Leaf**: A context-window-sized ticket that delivers one independently verifiable outcome and may be claimed by an agent when all of its hard blockers are closed.
- **Hard Blocker**: An unfinished ticket whose outcome is genuinely required before useful work can begin on another ticket. Hard blockers are represented with native issue dependencies; preferred order alone is not a blocker.
- **Coordination Relationship**: A non-blocking overlap between tickets that share an integration surface, validation environment, or product journey. Coordination relationships describe merge order and handoff expectations without removing tickets from the parallel frontier.
- **Agent Frontier**: The set of unassigned executable leaves with no open hard blockers and no requirement for human-only authority.
- **Human Gate**: A ticket requiring human authorization, protected credentials, destructive cloud action, production promotion, or subjective real-device validation. Human gates are prepared with reproducible evidence before being handed to a person.
- **Completion Evidence**: The commit, pull request, automated results, deployment observation, or human sign-off demonstrating that every acceptance criterion of a ticket is satisfied.

## Release Branches

- **`main`**: The sole long-lived integration and stable release branch, and the only Vercel production source.
- **`dev`**: A temporary consolidation branch for recovering and reviewing the combined Jules PR work in the current `dev` → `main` release (ADR 0050). It is not the steady-state target for new work.
- **Release PR (`dev` → `main`)**: The one-time reviewed handoff of the consolidated work to production.
- **Topic Branch**: A short-lived branch cut from `main` for one change and merged into `main` after its pull request gates pass.

## Logical Proof Workspace

### Deductive Inference Rules

- **Clausal Resolution (Res)**: Given $(A \lor B)$ and $(\neg A \lor C)$, cancels complementary literals to derive the resolvent $(B \lor C)$.
- **Conjunction Introduction / Elimination ($\land$-Intro / $\land$-Elim)**: From $P$ and $Q$ derive $P \land Q$; from $P \land Q$ derive $P$ or $Q$.
- **De Morgan's Laws**: $\neg(P \land Q) \iff (\neg P \lor \neg Q)$ and $\neg(P \lor Q) \iff (\neg P \land \neg Q)$.

- **Flexbox/Grid Intrinsic Width Neutralization (`min-w-0` / `min-h-0`)**: The mandatory application of `min-w-0` (or `min-h-0` in vertical flex layouts) on flex and grid children containing text elements, overriding CSS `min-width: auto` to permit proper word wrapping and truncation without layout expansion.
- **Differentiated Word Wrapping**: The structural pattern applying `break-words` (`overflow-wrap: break-word`) to editorial prose and headings, `break-all` / `overflow-wrap: anywhere` to unbroken identifiers/URLs, and horizontal scroll boundaries to complex mathematical AST ledgers.

### Stacking Contexts & Semantic Layer Scale

- **Section Stacking Isolation (`isolate`)**: The explicit application of CSS `isolation: isolate` on composite and layered multi-element sections, scoping internal `z-index` hierarchies and preventing z-index escalation bugs across sibling page components.
- **Standardized Layer Scale**: A bounded system-wide elevation hierarchy (background: `-z-10`, content: `relative z-10`, sticky navigation: `z-40`, modals and search palettes: `z-50`) replacing unmanaged arbitrary z-index values (`z-[9999]`).
- **Dynamic Viewport Height Adaptation (`dvh`)**: The responsive viewport scaling standard utilizing `min-h-dvh` across page wrappers and modal layouts to account for mobile browser dynamic UI expansion (address bars, bottom sheets).

### Defensive CSS & Component Independence

- **Container Query Encapsulation (`@container`)**: The practice of wrapping modular cards and widgets in CSS container contexts (`@container`) so internal layout shifts, font sizing, and flex directions react directly to parent container width rather than global viewport dimensions (`@media`).
- **Tablet-Adaptive Layout Invariant**: The structural layout rule ensuring mid-sized viewports (640px to 1023px) receive dedicated layout composition (e.g. 2-column bento grids, vertical hero console docking with balanced margins, slide-out tablet drawer navigation) preventing the cramped layouts caused by prematurely applying desktop-wide rules to tablet viewports.
- **Dynamic Content Stress Invariant**: The requirement that all text containers and card wrappers maintain visual integrity when populated with edge-case data: localized translations (+40% character expansion), long unbroken URLs/identifiers (100+ characters without spaces), and 200% simulated browser zoom.
- **Design Token Governance**: The architectural enforcement preventing arbitrary inline magic numbers (e.g. ad-hoc `h-[...px]`, `text-[...px]`, `z-[9999]`) in favor of centralized design manifest tokens and responsive clamp scales.

### Production Layout Validation Protocol

- **The 320px Squeeze Invariant**: The mobile boundary stress test validating that all rendered components, interactive studios, and cards operate without text truncation, layout distortion, or horizontal page scrolling on 320px-wide viewports (iPhone SE class).

- **Early Fail-Fast Boundary Enforcement**: The pre-commit pipeline execution policy in `.husky/pre-commit` positioning deep-module boundary linting (`npm run lint:boundaries`) immediately after TypeScript compilation (`typecheck`) and before test execution, failing within ~1.5s on architectural leaks.
- **Husky Commit Guard (`.husky/commit-msg`)**: Pre-commit hook interceptor preventing malformed or unclassified git commits from entering repository history.
- **Interactive Commit Wizard (`npm run dx commit`)**: Guided command-line interface generating compliant Conventional Commits with scope validation and breaking change indicators.
- **Branch Naming Standard**: Team-wide git branch naming convention requiring categorical prefixes (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `refactor/*`, `docs/*`, `perf/*`, `dx/*`, `test/*`, `main`).
- **Dual-Tracker Issue Slicing Pattern**: The engineering issue workflow combining local tracer-bullet ticket files (`.scratch/issues/*.md`) for isolated context-bounded autonomous implementation with bi-directional GitHub CLI integration (planned `npm run dx issues:sync`; not yet implemented, so synchronization is currently performed manually with the `gh` CLI per `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`), preserving dependency edges, automated triage labels, and verification checklists.

- **Garmin Thermal & CPU Telemetry Engine**: Deterministic physical simulation engine (`lib/garmin-engine.ts`, `components/arcade/GarminWatchClient.tsx`) modeling Connect IQ runtime CPU workloads, heat generation curves, passive wrist thermal dissipation, battery discharge profiles, and ANT+ heart rate sensor telemetry under active workload stress.
- **Monkey C Bytecode Emulation Scaffold**: Canvas-driven graphical rendering pipeline emulating high-contrast MIP (Memory-in-Pixel) transflective smartwatch displays, hardware bezel buttons, and Connect IQ OS lifecycle states with zero native C dependencies.

## Scientific & Engineering Editorial Design System

### Visual Identity & Interactive Telemetry

- **Hero Engineering Console**: An interactive, multi-modal hero telemetry component allowing visitors to interactively test and verify domain invariants (AST Premise Discharging in Formal Logic, CDISC 21 CFR Part 11 Conformance Auditing, and Garmin 32KB Memory Heap Allocation) with contextual handoff links to full interactive studio workspaces.
- **Scientific & Engineering Editorial Design System**: A high-assurance visual and interaction design architecture emphasizing Swiss grid precision, deep architectural graphite surfaces (`#0d0e11`, `#13151a`), crisp hairline structural borders (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` / `border-zinc-800`), and semantic status indicators (Precision Amber `#f59e0b`, Emerald `#10b981`, Steel `#94a3b8`) eliminating generic AI tropes (falling collision particles, diffuse neon glows).
- **Dual-Layer Editorial Persona**: An editorial and narrative framework blending warm, self-deprecating storytelling with dry, battle-tested engineering and clinical operations wit as the baseline voice, while using interactive toggles ("Recruiter vs. Reality") and micro-copy to expose unvarnished, hilarious technical reality.
- **The "Make Things Better" Ethos**: The personal philosophy and track record defining Frederick's journey: finding practical solutions to real human problems and leaving every environment better than he found it—from securing free menstrual products in campus bathrooms and serving as university liaison for the Minnesota Vikings Training Camp, to 3D printing MRI brain models at Mayo Clinic, sparking the cultural Laser Loon phenomenon, and engineering intuitive, bulletproof software.
- **System-Agnostic Problem Solver**: The core positioning and ethos defining Frederick not by rigid software titles or academic jargon, but as a pragmatic, relentless troubleshooter who dives into any system—campus initiatives, hospital EHRs, Linux pipelines, smartwatches, or modern web apps—to find fixes, help people out, and make things work smoothly.
- **Plain-Language Clarity Invariant**: The requirement that the primary narrative, headlines, hero copy, and project introductions must pass the "Family & Friends" test—explaining who Frederick is, what was built, why it matters, and why it's cool in clear, relatable, engaging human terms with zero alienating buzzwords before offering optional deep-dive technical telemetry.
- **Systems Dossier & Spec Index**: A numbered engineering project showcase (`SYS-01`, `SYS-02`, `SYS-03`, `SYS-04`) surfacing explicit architectural constraints, test coverage badges, language specs, and direct pathways to deep-dive case studies.

## Resilient Hybrid Fallback Data Architecture

### Serverless Prerender Resilience & Data Sourcing

- **Resilient Hybrid Fallback**: The unified data retrieval strategy implemented in `CaseStudyService` that queries the remote PostgreSQL/Neon database first, seamlessly unions or falls back to static compilation data (`FALLBACK_CASE_STUDIES`) upon missing records or connection errors, and returns `notFound()` for invalid entities rather than failing static builds.
- **Database-Priority Sourcing**: Sourcing protocol where live database records take precedence for matching entity slugs, while any newly introduced or unseeded static case studies in the codebase are automatically appended to the collection.
- **5-Point Discovery Matrix**: The unified multi-surface synchronization invariant linking every first-class case study and interactive tool across Command Palette (`CommandPalette.tsx`), Desktop/Mobile Navigation (`Navbar.tsx`), Footer (`Footer.tsx`), SEO/Sitemap registries (`sitemap.ts`, `seo-metadata.ts`), and Real-Browser Benchmark configs (`page-bench.ts`).
- **Deterministic SSG Telemetry Fallback**: The resilient build-time data acquisition strategy in `lib/github.ts` that gracefully absorbs GitHub API 404/403 rate-limit states during static page prerendering, returning mathematical simulated commit and language telemetry without emitting false-alarm stderr noise.

## Identity, Authentication & Admin Governance

### Edge Authentication & Access Control

- **Next.js 16 Edge Proxy**: The network-edge request interception handler (`proxy.ts`) in Next.js 16 executing before route rendering to attach standard HTTP security headers, rate limit incoming API requests, and generate anonymous Web Crypto SHA-256 connection fingerprint tokens.
- **Admin & Author Portal**: A dedicated protected workspace (`/admin`, `/api/admin`) providing administrative tools for drafting case studies, modifying editorial content, and inspecting raw analytics telemetry without exposing write capabilities to public visitors.
- **Clerk Edge Middleware Chaining**: The edge pipeline composing `@clerk/nextjs` `clerkMiddleware` with standard HTTP security headers (`applySecurityHeaders`) and privacy-preserving client connection hashing (`generateClientConnectionHash`), enforcing route protection via `createRouteMatcher` while allowing public route bypass.
- **Environment-Gated Admin Authorization**: Server-side access control validating authenticated Clerk identities (`userId`, `emailAddress`) against typed environment variable allowlists (`ADMIN_USER_IDS`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`) declared in `lib/env.ts`.
- **In-Route Access Denied Console**: An in-route 403 authorization boundary surface on `/admin` that gracefully displays an authenticated visitor's Clerk UID, primary email address, and 1-click copyable environment configuration instructions alongside account-switching actions, preventing unhandled server exception crashes and false-alarm Sentry error reports.

## Case Study Domain & Editorial Architecture

### Content Structure & Bidirectional Discovery

- **High-Assurance Systems Case Study Standard**: The canonical 5-section technical structure governing all portfolio case studies: 1. Executive Summary & Problem Solved, 2. Deep Dive Architecture & Design Patterns, 3. System Design & Runtime Data Flow (Mermaid), 4. Key Technical Challenges & Production Code Snippets, and 5. Trade-Offs, Edge Cases & Lessons Learned.
- **Bidirectional Project Seam**: The linkage contract ensuring every case study explicitly pairs its external source repository (`github_url`) or primary artifact (e.g. Kaggle notebook) with relevant internal interactive tools or live simulators (`interactive_url`) and vice versa.
- **Multi-Action Hero Bar**: A prominent action header on case study pages rendering primary source links (GitHub repository, Kaggle notebook, PyPI/npm package), live/simulated repository telemetry, and internal interactive studio launcher shortcuts.
- **Platform-Agnostic Source Linking**: A flexible source linkage model gracefully supporting projects where the primary artifact is an external platform (e.g. Kaggle notebook or package registry) rather than a traditional GitHub repository, adapting badges and telemetry without build-time or runtime exceptions.
- **Interactive CLI Developer Sandbox**: The client-side terminal interface (`commands_json`, `playback_json`, `SandboxTerminal`) rendering realistic command outputs and step-by-step playback workflows directly inside case study pages.
- **FluentUI Case Study Easter Egg**: A scoped Office Fluent Design System visual override active on `/case-studies/crf-xl` evoking classic Microsoft Excel taskpane aesthetics without compromising global dark-mode layout integrity.
- **Tracer-Bullet Case Study Rollout**: The phased verification protocol establishing generalized UI contracts and multi-source telemetry first before sequentially integrating, testing, and closing individual case study issues.

## Blog & Engineering Dispatch Editorial Architecture

### Scope & Governance

- **`BlogPost`**: The Prisma-backed content type (governed by ADR 0041) representing a single long-form blog post — cross-project, retrospective, or narrative writing that carries no requirement to be anchored to a shippable artifact. Authored via `/admin` through the same content pipeline and sanitization boundary as `CaseStudy`, not as in-repo MDX.
- **Blog/Case-Study Scope Boundary**: The governing distinction (ADR 0041 §2) that a piece requiring a `github_url` or primary artifact to make sense is a `CaseStudy`, while a piece that would still make sense with zero code attached is a `BlogPost`. `BlogPost` never adopts the mandatory 5-section High-Assurance Systems Case Study Standard.
- **Systems Dispatch Archive**: The blog's role as the permanent, indexable, RSS-syndicated home for the previously-homeless **Systems Dispatch Newsletter** (`lib/services/email-service.ts`), giving periodic technical retrospectives a permalink instead of only an outbound email.
- **Content Pillar Taxonomy**: The closed six-value enum (`BlogPost.pillar`) organizing all posts — Clinical Data Engineering & CDISC Standards, Formal Verification & AST/Compiler Theory, Accessibility & Cognitive-Reading Engineering, Browser Graphics/Canvas & Game Engineering, Agent-First DX & Tooling, and Field Notes: Make Things Better — each mapped to a tier of the Target Search Intent Hierarchy.
- **`BlogPostReaction`**: The reader-engagement schema mirroring `CaseStudyReaction` exactly (keyed by `blogPostSlug` instead of `caseStudySlug`), providing the blog's entire reader-response surface — deliberately excluding any discussion-forum-style comment system.

## Search Engine Optimization & Discovery Architecture

### Search Strategy & Intent Hierarchy

- **Omni-Channel Tiered Search Funnel**: A three-tier organic discovery architecture that captures broad top-of-funnel traffic via viral cultural asset hubs (Laser Loon vector distribution) and interactive browser utilities (CRF Studio, Proof Workspace, NeuroRecon), seamlessly channeling high-intent visitors toward high-assurance systems case studies, technical dossiers, and direct 1:1 consultation scheduling (`/schedule`).
- **Target Search Intent Hierarchy**: The structured segmentation of search queries into three distinct intent classes: 1. High-Intent Systems & Recruiter Discovery (clinical software architecture, formal verification, embedded systems), 2. Open Creative Commons Asset Distribution (Laser Loon vector downloads, Minnesota state flag submission F277), and 3. Public Web Utility Tooling (online CDASH/ODM-XML validators, deductive logic solvers, FreeSurfer mesh repair).

### Structured Data & Entity Graph Architecture

- **Unified Schema.org `@graph` Engine**: A centralized structured data generator (`lib/seo.ts`) linking all page-level entities (`Person`, `WebSite`, `WebPage`, `BreadcrumbList`, `SoftwareApplication`, `TechArticle`, `VisualArtwork`) into a single interconnected JSON-LD `@graph` with deterministic `@id` URI nodes (`#person`, `#website`).
- **Specialized Schema Dispatcher**: A tier-aware schema generator routing page types to optimal Schema.org definitions (e.g. `VisualArtwork` & `MediaObject` with Creative Commons licensing for graphic design assets like Laser Loon, `WebApplication` for browser-based interactive studios, and `SoftwareSourceCode` / `TechArticle` for deep-dive systems case studies).

### Visual & Media Discovery

- **Tiered Dynamic Social Preview Generator**: The Satori-based OpenGraph and Twitter card rendering pipeline (`lib/og-image.tsx`) providing tier-specific visual presets (`CLINICAL_SYSTEMS`, `FORMAL_VERIFICATION`, `VECTOR_ARTWORK`, `EMBEDDED_SIMULATOR`) with live GitHub telemetry badges and 1200x630 dimension compliance.
- **Google Image Sitemap Extension**: XML image metadata integration in `app/sitemap.ts` attaching image locations, captions, titles, and Creative Commons licensing tags directly to canonical route entries for Google Image Search crawling.

### Semantic Metadata & Search Copy Standards

- **Front-Loaded SERP Optimization Standard**: The metadata authoring rule in `lib/seo-metadata.ts` restricting page titles to 50–60 characters with high-intent primary capability keywords front-loaded before brand suffixes, pairing 145–155 character action-oriented descriptions with active CTR verbs (_Explore_, _Download_, _Simulate_, _Verify_).
- **Long-Tail Semantic Tagging**: The practice of replacing generic single-word tags (`"React"`, `"TypeScript"`) with specialized multi-word domain search phrases (`"CDISC ODM-XML validator"`, `"Laser Loon vector download"`, `"Lean formal proof simulator"`).

### Crawl Governance & Sitemap Invariants

- **Dynamic Sitemap Registry**: The automated route compilation architecture in `app/sitemap.ts` dynamically aggregating routes from `ROUTE_METADATA_CONFIGS` in `lib/seo-metadata.ts` and dynamic database records in `CaseStudyService` to guarantee 100% route indexing coverage with zero manual drift.
- **Robots Crawl Boundary Invariant**: The robots governance policy in `app/robots.ts` ensuring private routes (`/admin`, `/api/`, `/_next/`) remain strictly excluded from search crawler indexing while publishing canonical sitemap endpoints.

## Transactional Communication & Outbound Notification Architecture

### Inbound & Outbound Messaging

- **Inbound Visitor Inquiry**: A direct message submitted through the portfolio contact surface containing visitor contact coordinates, intent category (e.g. general, collaboration, consulting), subject, and message content.
- **Admin Feedback Alert**: An automated notification dispatched to site administrators upon new case study feedback submissions, telemetry anomalies, or critical system events.
- **Transactional Email Dispatcher**: The unified outbound communication engine responsible for validating payloads, enforcing anti-abuse rate limits, orchestrating message delivery via Resend, and providing environment-isolated mock fallbacks.
- **Architectural Email Template**: High-contrast, responsive HTML email markup adhering to Swiss typography and portfolio design tokens (`#0d0e11`, Precision Amber `#f59e0b`, hairline micro-borders) with DOM-purified content.
- **Frictionless Bot Barrier**: Multi-layered anti-abuse defense combining invisible honeypot traps, timestamp duration gates, anonymous connection-hash rate limiting, and content tone moderation without third-party CAPTCHA scripts.
- **Systems Dispatch Newsletter**: A lightweight subscription mechanism delivering periodic technical retrospectives on formal verification, AST compilers, CDISC clinical data systems, and browser physics, managed through `lib/services/email-service.ts` (`subscribeNewsletter`) and `/api/newsletter`.
- **Zero-Exfiltration Channel Isolation**: The architectural standard requiring that direct personal email addresses (`fpderuiter@gmail.com`) and unauthenticated `mailto:` links are completely scrubbed from public DOM nodes, footer components, and JSON-LD structured schemas (`lib/seo.ts`), directing all inbound communications exclusively through authenticated, rate-limited, and honeypot-protected endpoints (`/contact`, `<ContactForm />`, and `/api/contact`).
- **Resend Inbound Webhook & Bounce Processing Engine**: The deliverability ingestion pipeline (`/api/webhooks/resend`) utilizing cryptographic signature verification (Svix) to process deliverability lifecycle events (`email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.bounced`, `email.complained`), maintaining suppression lists and recording telemetry.
- **Resilient Transactional Outbound Retry Queue**: A decoupled retry queue mechanism safeguarding transactional dispatches (visitor inquiries, newsletter welcomes, admin alerts) against upstream provider rate limits (429) and transient API faults with exponential backoff and persistent state fallback.

## Design System & Layout Architecture

### High-Assurance UI/UX & Responsive Primitives

- **High-Assurance Architectural Design System**: The unified frontend styling and layout architecture combining warm architectural graphite (`#0d0e11`, `#13151a`), amber/cyan accents, hairline micro-borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`), CSS Container Queries (`@container`), fluid typography, and tactile micro-interactions (`active:scale-[0.98]`).
- **Defensive Container Query Layout**: The responsive strategy utilizing CSS `@container`, `@sm:`, `@md:` and `min-w-0` on dynamic modular cards and interactive tools to isolate internal component layout adaptations from global viewport media queries and prevent layout blowouts.
- **Tactile Interaction Standard**: Micro-interaction feedback across all interactive cards, modals, and buttons combining calibrated spring physics (`--motion-spring-snappy`), active tactile scaling (`active:scale-[0.98]`), high-contrast focus rings (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-amber-500/50`), and `reduced-motion` accessibility fallbacks.
- **High-Assurance Modular Bento**: A responsive layout pattern using CSS Container Queries (`@container`), adaptive typography, and structured hierarchy to present complex technical case studies, live telemetry, and interactive sandbox tools side-by-side without layout blowouts.
- **Bidirectional Studio Seam**: Direct deep-linking navigation between written technical case studies and their live interactive workspace counterparts (e.g. `/case-studies/crf-xl` ↔ `/crf`, `/case-studies/formal-verification` ↔ `/proof`).
- **Proof Workspace Modular Architecture**: The decoupled decomposition of the formal verification DAG studio into distinct single-responsibility sub-modules (`ProofHeader`, `ProofCanvas`, `ProofInspector`, `ProofLedger`, `ProofExportModal`, `InteractiveTruthTable`) sharing typed hook state.
- **Segmented Mobile Studio Paradigm**: The responsive interaction model decomposing multi-pane desktop studios (CRF Studio, Proof Workspace) into focused single-pane views switched via a native segmented bottom bar on viewports `< 768px`.
- **Dynamic 100dvh Fullscreen Stage**: An isolated, touch-safe, zero-overflow full-viewport presentation mode (`fixed inset-0 z-50 w-full h-[100dvh] bg-black select-none touch-none overflow-hidden`) that uses CSS aspect containment to fit canvas games, HUDs, and touch triggers within dynamic mobile browser viewports with zero layout shift or vertical scrolling.
- **Game-Aware Touch Ergonomics**: Selective touch control mounting where directional arcade games render compact D-pads and action buttons, while drag/puzzle/tap games suppress overlays in favor of direct canvas gesture manipulation.

## Type-Safe Contracts & Test Fixture Hygiene

### Spec & Handler Architecture

- **Spec & Handler Pattern**: Architectural pattern separating an operation's capability contract (`spec.ts` defining input schema, error taxonomy enum, result type, and interface) from its execution logic (`handler.ts` containing side effects, orchestration, and zero-throw error mappings).
- **Dual-Seam Architecture**: High-performance engine integration pattern keeping core 60 FPS physics and AST mathematical evaluators synchronous and fast, while wrapping boundary state mutations and external commands in typed Spec & Handler contracts.
- **ServiceResult Envelope**: Standardized discriminated union envelope (`{ success: true, data: T } | { success: false, error: ServiceError<E> }`) returning typed values instead of throwing unhandled exceptions.
- **Exhaustive Error Code Enums**: Domain-specific Zod string enums defining all possible failure modes for an operation, guaranteeing comprehensive error branch handling without generic catch-all strings.

### Test Fixture Hygiene & Shoehorn

- **Shoehorn Test Fixture Hygiene**: The testing standard replacing unsafe type assertions (`as unknown as TargetType` or `as TargetType`) in test suites with `@total-typescript/shoehorn`'s `fromPartial()` (for partial data DTOs) and `fromAny()` (for intentionally invalid test payloads), ensuring test fixtures do not mask underlying schema regressions.
- **Contract Test / Logic Test Separation**: The practice of splitting test coverage into contract tests (`spec.test.ts` testing schema parsing and edge-case rejections) and handler logic tests (`handler.test.ts` asserting business logic and error mapping).

## Free-Tier Offloading & Cloud Provider Quota Governance

### Provider Quotas & Edge Protection

- **Free-Tier Offloading Architecture**: The architectural pattern of delegating high-frequency, long-running, or state-heavy operations (caching, rate-limiting, event buffering, background retry queues, asset storage) away from Vercel Hobby serverless limits onto external generous free tiers to eliminate hosting costs while providing production-grade scalability.
- **Edge Rate-Limit Shield**: The practice of evaluating client rate limits via `@upstash/ratelimit` at the network edge (Next.js Edge Proxy / Middleware) before requests enter serverless execution, rejecting automated traffic and bot attacks before serverless function execution hours or downstream provider quotas are consumed.
- **Provider Quota Boundary**: Explicit operating constraints matching free-tier service caps (Resend: 100 emails/day, Upstash Redis: 10,000 commands/day, Sentry: 10,000 performance spans/month, Neon: 0.5 GiB storage and auto-suspending compute) configured with defense-in-depth fallbacks to prevent silent drops or surprise provider billing.
- **Read-Through Compute Shield**: Caching remote relational database queries (such as published case studies, author records, and aggregate interaction counters) in a globally distributed Redis store (Upstash) with stale-while-revalidate or mutation-based invalidation, allowing serverless Postgres compute (Neon) to remain suspended in zero-compute sleep states across public visitor browsing.
- **Unified Maintenance Pipeline**: A consolidated, time-budgeted scheduled execution model consolidating disparate recurring tasks (telemetry rollups, outbound retry queue processing, and retention data pruning) into a single secured invocation satisfying Vercel Hobby's strict limitation of one daily scheduled job.
- **Two-Tier Cache Shield**: The tiered caching strategy pairing Vercel Edge Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for static long-lived page rendering with Upstash Redis for volatile interactive counters and write-buffering, eliminating database read compute while providing real-time UI interactivity.
- **Sub-Daily Event-Driven Dispatch**: The execution pattern using external free-tier webhooks or schedulers (such as Upstash QStash) to dispatch time-sensitive background retries with exponential backoff, overcoming Vercel Hobby's single daily cron restriction without requiring paid infrastructure upgrades.
- **GitHub Actions Resource Governance**: The operating discipline of using standard hosted runners and bounded jobs, avoiding duplicate gating runs, and tracking artifact/cache storage separately; this repository currently receives free standard-runner minutes as a public repository.
- **Zero-Neon-Wake Read Boundary**: The architectural invariant ensuring that public unauthenticated reads (such as blog reaction counts, post views, or public metadata) read exclusively from Upstash Redis or static ISR and never wake sleeping Neon database compute when cache keys are cold or uninitialized.
- **MediaStorageProvider**: A pluggable, typed storage abstraction (`lib/services/media-storage.ts`) decoupling application media operations from serverless ephemeral runtimes, directing assets to Vercel Blob (or S3/Cloudflare R2) in production while falling back to deterministic local disk persistence (`.media-storage/`) during development and testing.
- **SVG Defense-in-Depth**: A multi-layered sanitization and transport security standard for user-uploaded vector assets, combining strict server-side DOMPurify tag/attribute scrubbing (eliminating `<script>`, inline event handlers, and foreign objects) with transport-level isolation headers (`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`).
- **Atomic Buffer Mutation**: A concurrent mutation technique utilizing Upstash Redis pipelines to atomically evaluate duplicate rate-limiting rules (via SHA-256 connection hashes) and increment aggregate counters in a single round-trip, returning explicit HTTP 429 semantics upon duplicate submission without leaking compute into relational persistence.

## Dyslexia-First Typography & Cognitive Accessibility Architecture

### Typographic Engines & Reading Science

- **Dyslexia-First Typography Stack**: A multi-tiered typographic hierarchy engineered for readers with dyslexia and cognitive reading fatigue, combining Atkinson Hyperlegible (low-vision character disambiguation), Lexend (empirically validated character pacing and reading fluency), and OpenDyslexic (spatial anchoring via heavy bottom-weighted letterforms).
- **Character Disambiguation**: The typographic design principle (pioneered by the Braille Institute's Atkinson Hyperlegible) of giving distinct visual shapes to historically ambiguous glyph pairs (e.g. uppercase `I`, lowercase `l`, and numeral `1`; numeral `0` and letter `O`; mirrored pairs `b`/`d` and `p`/`q`; and character clusters `rn` vs `m`).
- **Typographic Pacing & Fluency**: The cognitive reading optimization (embodied in Lexend) that systematically scales character width and inter-glyph tracking to prevent visual crowding, line skipping, and perceptual letter merging.
- **Dynamic Dyslexia Mode**: A client-side persistent accessibility state (`useFontPreference` / `A11yProvider`) that dynamically toggles the active DOM font stack between the default Atkinson/Lexend hybrid and OpenDyslexic across all public UI surfaces and the userland Pretext text measurement engine.
- **Family-Anchored Accessibility Invariant**: The foundational design commitment ensuring that every interface, navigation element, and technical article in the portfolio is directly legible, usable, and comfortable for Frederick's brother and readers with dyslexia, prioritizing human reading accessibility above conventional design aesthetics.

## Patrol Shift (Ski Patrol Judgment Simulator)

### Mountain Operations & Geospatial Terrain Engine

- **Patrol Shift Simulator**: An interactive Midwest ski patrol judgment and triage simulation (`/patrol`) modeling Welch Village field operations, Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) clinical triage, Outdoor Emergency Transportation (OET) toboggan descent, and non-clinical mountain management.
- **Interactive Mountain Viewport**: A responsive pan-and-zoom SVG canvas representing Welch Village's terrain, trails, lifts, and infrastructure across multiple sectors with dual-zone toggling, real-time coordinate transformations, minimap radar tracking, and altitude interpolation.
- **Dual-Zone Sector View**: The geospatial partitioning of Welch Village into two primary operational camera zones—East & West Slopes (Main Mountain) and The Back Bowl—each with dedicated viewport framing, trail visibility, and elevation context.
- **Catmull-Rom Spline Pipeline**: The mathematical interpolation technique converting discrete geographic survey points into smooth, continuous cubic Bézier curve paths for trail centerlines, supporting double-pass rendering (casing + core) and grooming textures (solid corduroy vs. dashed moguls).
- **Slope Profile Sparkline**: An SVG elevation cross-section graph rendered in the trail inspector card, visualizing trail altitude loss from summit to base alongside calculated average gradient percentage.
- **Parametric Skier Run Simulation**: A physics-driven animation mode descending Catmull-Rom trail splines with tangent angle derivation, carving roll, and dynamic snow spray particle generation.
- **Aerial Chairlift Physics Loop**: Continuous kinetic evaluation of aerial cable lines and chair carriers with tower pylon crossarms, counter-rotating carrier offsets, and strict `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks.
- **Emergency Dispatch Beacon**: An animated, pulsing radar beacon ring anchored to exact trail or lift tower coordinates on the mountain map during active incident dispatch and response states.
- **Ambient Operational Mini-Event**: A brief (10–30s) non-clinical mountain event occurring on the map hub between dispatches (guest assistance, boundary control, trail hazard mitigation, lift coordination, dispatch radio checks) reflecting that patrol manages the entire mountain environment.
- **Your Responsibility Code**: The 10-point National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) skier and snowboarder safety ruleset accessible directly from the mountain hub to reinforce operational mountain safety culture.

## Trial & Error: Biostat Ops (Clinical-Output Deckbuilder)

Fictional teaching material; nothing in the game is clinical or regulatory advice. See [ADR 0046](adr/0046-trial-and-error-biostat-ops-architecture.md).

- **SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan)**: The scenario's authoritative rulebook. It declares the population suit, any population aliases, decimal precision and rounding mode, and the rules a staged output is validated against. No precision or rounding convention is assumed outside it.
- **TLF (Tables, Listings & Figures)**: The outputs of a clinical study report. In the game they are the cards that form scoring hands.
- **Table Shell**: The planned specification of an output (`TableShellSpec`): number, title, card type, target population, Chips and +Mult weight, and required rulebook.
- **Population Snapshot**: An immutable, versioned record of which subjects belong to which analysis population. Every denominator is derived from it, never from the table under review.
- **Analysis Population (Suit)**: `SCREENED`, `ITT`, `SAFETY`, `PER_PROTOCOL` or `FAS`. FAS and ITT are distinct unless a scenario's SAP declares an alias.
- **QC Discrepancy (Finding)**: A validator result that ties one cell to one SAP rule, with category (denominator, value, precision, rounding), severity, observed and expected values, evidence, and consequence.
- **QC Desk**: The review surface where a staged output is inspected cell by cell, findings are revealed and corrected, and the hand is approved and played or rejected and discarded.
- **Chips**: A hand's base weight: the hand's base Chips plus output, rule and relic Chips.
- **+Mult / ×Mult**: Additive and multiplicative multipliers. A hand scores `Chips × (Σ +Mult) × (Π ×Mult)`.
- **Zero-Score Rule**: Any rule result carrying ×0 (an uncorrected fatal denominator error, or closed-session unblinding) sets final Mult to 0.
- **Redline**: A revealed, uncorrected non-fatal finding that subtracts its rule's penalty from +Mult.
- **Blind**: A milestone delivery quota (Small, Big or Boss) the round score must reach. The Small Blind is the player's own team, the Big Blind is the client or an open committee session, and the Boss is someone who can stop the program.
- **Hand**: A scored combination of outputs, from High Table (15 Chips / +1 Mult) to MedDRA Five of a Kind (200 / +18).
- **CPU**: The action budget: the milestone's allocation on the statistics compute grid. Approve & Play costs 2 CPU; Reject & Discard costs 1 CPU.
- **Draw Pile**: The ordered drafts a scenario stages; each draw is a programmer compiling one of the player's shells against the current snapshot. It is fixed per scenario; seeded randomness is reserved for the crisis deck and the shop.
- **Card Table**: The main screen. It shows a hand of TLF cards, from which the player selects up to five to play as a poker hand against the Blind.
- **Inspect**: Opening a card's QC Desk for CPU to reveal and correct its hidden defects, standing for the independent double-programming compare. Playing an uninspected card is a gamble, because an undiscovered fatal defect still zeroes the hand.
- **Loud Moment**: A discrete, event-driven burst of saturated colour, glow, shake or CRT effect (score resolution, Blind cleared, shop, boss intro), scoped inside the cabinet. It is disabled under reduced motion and below 768px.
- **Card Face**: The live mini-output printed on a card from its data: a miniature table, subject listing, plot or cohort chip, with the population suit written in text and a stamp slot (REDLINE, QC ✓).
- **Card Back**: The shared face-down design. It renders only a redacted slot, so an undealt or blinded card carries no face values.
- **Juice Kit**: The cabinet's reusable effects: named synthesized sound cues, an ambient music loop, and CSS-only loud-moment layers (CRT, swirl, capped shake, flame and glow). Later features trigger effects by name.
- **Score Timeline**: The ordered, pure sequence of scoring events derived from `HandEvaluation`. The UI plays it back as animation, instant tally and screen-reader narration, and never computes a score itself.
- **Guidance Card**: A consumable named after real guidance (ICH E3, E9, E2A, CDISC IGs) that permanently levels up one hand type for the run. Documents are always Guidance cards, never relics.
- **Act (Study)**: One of the run's three studies of the same compound: Phase I (First in Human), Phase II (Proof of Concept) and Phase III (Blinded Pivotal). The deck, relics, hand levels and budget carry over; subjects, snapshots, the SAP and compiled outputs reset.
- **Boss Pool**: The bosses an act can draw from the seeded event draw. Act I draws the Dose Escalation Committee, Act II draws a DMC closed session or an End-of-Phase-2 FDA Information Request, and Act III is always CSR Lock.
- **FDA Information Request (IR)**: The End-of-Phase-2 boss. Each targeted question names the output that answers it, and a scored hand containing that output answers it once the hand's score covers the question's share of the quota. The response goes in at most two hands, against a deterministic 48-hour clock that every move spends.
- **Clinical Hold**: The loss of an FDA Information Request: the clock no longer leaves time to play a hand while questions are open. It ends the run.
- **Relic (SOP Relic)**: A passive modifier that is a person or a tool on the player's team, such as a lead programmer, a validated macro suite or a double-programming SOP.
- **Site Activation Pack**: A booster pack that enrolls new subjects into the current study, adding Chips and creating a new population snapshot that stales dependent outputs.
- **Blinding Firewall**: The CRO's separation between its blinded study team and its independent DMC statisticians. The player works both seats; peeking across triggers the zero-score rule.
- **Stake (GCP Audit Level)**: A cumulative difficulty tier for a run, from Routine Monitoring to Warning Letter.
- **Sponsor (Starter Sponsor)**: A starting configuration for a run: starting deck, starting item and one rule twist, such as Oncology Pharma or Virtual Biotech (the default). The sponsor is the client whose compound the player is developing.

## Critical-Path Performance & Web Vitals Architecture

### Pretext LCP Candidacy & Hydration Layout Isolation

- **Visible Pretext LCP Candidacy**: The architectural requirement (ADR 0052, #817) that above-the-fold heading and text elements rendered via the Pretext text layout engine (`HeroHeadline`, `HeroText`) present an authentic, visible, and fully opaque semantic element on initial server paint (SSR) rather than a transparent semantic twin overlay (`color: transparent`), allowing Chromium and WebKit paint engines to immediately attribute Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) to the semantic heading without animation render delays.
- **Transform-Only Hero Entrance**: Staggered typography entrance animations bounded strictly to GPU compositor properties (`transform: translate3d(...)` / `scale(...)`) without initial `opacity: 0`, ensuring continuous paint candidacy across all animation frames and zero layout thrash.
- **Pervasive Lazy Geometry**: The performance pattern deferring layout reads (`getBoundingClientRect()`) away from component mount and hydration loops, caching geometry lazily on user pointer interaction (`onPointerMove`) and invalidating via `rectRef.current = null` on window/container resize.
- **Non-Reflowing Dimension Estimation**: Prioritizing non-blocking ResizeObserver entries (`entry.contentRect.width`) and cached metrics over synchronous DOM layout queries during React hydration.
- **Route-Scoped CSS Partitioning**: Decoupling heavyweight route-specific animation and cabinet styling (such as arcade tokens, CRT scanlines, and landscape orientation media queries) into dedicated route stylesheets (`app/arcade/arcade.css`) imported by route layouts (`app/arcade/layout.tsx`), minimizing the critical render-blocking CSS payload on the root landing page (`/`).
- **Throttled Mobile Benchmark Profile**: Standardized Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) emulation profile (4x CPU slowdown, 1.6 Mbps download, 750 kbps upload, 150 ms RTT) configured in page benchmarking tooling (`scripts/benchmark-pages.ts`, `lib/dx/page-bench.ts`) providing reproducible Core Web Vitals evidence under constrained mobile network and CPU conditions.

## Editorial & Prose Punctuation Standard

Authored reader-facing prose across the portfolio avoids em-dash punctuation. Sentences rely instead on positive syntactic structure: colons introduce explanations or subtitles, commas separate dependent clauses, semicolons join closely paired assertions, and periods mark distinct complete thoughts.

### Display Contracts & Invariant Boundaries

Not every horizontal bar represents prose punctuation. To prevent destructive global character replacements, maintain a strict boundary between authored prose and functional code or data artifacts:

- **Missing-Value Placeholders**: Constants such as `NOT_ESTIMABLE = "—"` in clinical calculation engines, empty table cells (`| — |`) in inventory reports, and UI fallback indicators (`{value || "—"}`) are semantic display contracts. They are not prose and must remain unchanged.
- **Syntax, Code Identifiers & Regex**: Property keys, terminal prompt formatting, and regular expressions containing unicode characters or escape sequences are out of scope.
- **Verbatim Legal Text & Quotes**: Third-party license agreements (for example, `public/files/LICENSE.txt`) and exact historical citations remain unchanged.

### Context-Sensitive Replacement Matrix

When refactoring authored copy, select replacement punctuation based on the grammatical relationship and semantic intent of the sentence:

| Syntactic Context                       | Target Punctuation                            | Before (Em-Dash)                                      | After (Positive Replacement)                            |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title / Subtitle & Mode Tooltips**    | Colon (`:`)                                   | `Technical Reading Mode — Deep-dive architecture`     | `Technical Reading Mode: Deep-dive architecture`        |
| **Metadata Tags & Status Delimiters**   | Middle Dot (`·`) or Hyphen (`-`)              | `${study.primary_language} — ${study.tags}`           | `${study.primary_language} · ${study.tags}`             |
| **Date Ranges & Temporal Spans**        | Preposition ("to")                            | `March 2023 — Present`                                | `March 2023 to Present`                                 |
| **Dialogue & Radio Transmissions**      | Colon (`:`) or Semicolon (`;`)                | `Patrol 6, radio check — what's your status?`         | `Patrol 6, radio check: what is your status?`           |
| **Conversational Thought Interruption** | Semicolon (`;`), Period (`.`), or Comma (`,`) | `Vitals are stable — we'll self-transport.`           | `Vitals are stable; we will self-transport.`            |
| **Quotation Attributions**              | Typography / `<cite>` Tag                     | `"${q.quote}" — ${q.author}`                          | `"${q.quote}"` with `<cite>by ${q.author}</cite>`       |
| **Parenthetical Elaboration**           | Parentheses or Sentence Split                 | `Tuning systems—like prompt engineering—takes rigor.` | `Tuning systems (like prompt engineering) takes rigor.` |

### Editorial Governance & Workflow Invariants

- **Accessible Name Parity**: In interactive navigation and toggle controls, maintain 100% semantic parity between `aria-label` descriptions and hover `title` tooltips.
- **Documentation Synchronization**: When editing exported JSDoc comments or public API descriptions, regenerate TypeDoc markdown using `npm run compile-docs` and verify zero drift with `npm run check-docs-drift`.
- **Database-Backed CMS Content**: Update repository-controlled seed data (`prisma/seed.ts`) and static fallbacks (`lib/fallback-blog-posts.ts`) within the pull request. For live Neon PostgreSQL records, provide an explicit record-by-record checklist for the content owner to update through the authorized `/admin` CMS flow.
- **Verification Standard**: Verify copy changes with desktop and narrow-mobile smoke tests (320px viewport clearance) to ensure replacement punctuation introduces no text overflow or layout wrapping regressions.
