# Security Policy

## Layout Engine (`@chenglou/pretext`)

This project relies on the `@chenglou/pretext` library as its core text layout engine to achieve high performance. Since this library processes user-facing and dynamically injected text, it is important to understand its security posture.

- The `pretext` library maintains specific security boundaries and policies regarding vulnerabilities, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) behaviors that could theoretically stem from processing extremely long or maliciously crafted text inputs.
- If you discover or suspect any upstream vulnerabilities within the layout engine itself, **do not** open public issues. Instead, report them privately through the official GitHub vulnerability reporting flow for the [pretext repository](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext).
