/**
 * npm does not read .env files, so `npm run build` starts with none of them in
 * process.env. scripts/build.js spawns `next build` with `env: process.env`, and
 * a variable already present in the environment beats any .env file -- so an
 * offline dummy assigned before the .env files are loaded silently wins over a
 * perfectly good .env.local, and the build produces fallback content.
 *
 * That is what happened on 2026-09-18: two builds reported success having never
 * contacted a database.
