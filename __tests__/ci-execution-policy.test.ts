/**
 * CI-02 (#733 follow-up): before this policy existed, the targeted
 * non-chromium visual/touch coverage (`visual.spec.ts`, `touch-controls.spec.ts`
 * against Tablet Safari / Mobile Safari / Mobile Chrome) ran only in a
 * `push`-only job (`post-merge-device-smoke`), *after* a squash-merge had
 * already landed the change on `main`. A PR could merge with a device-engine
 * regression nothing had caught yet. These tests pin the fix: that coverage
 * must be part of the pull_request execution graph, and a single required
 * job (`merge-gate`) must be unable to report success unless every job that
 * gates the merge actually succeeded -- not merely "didn't block" by being
 * skipped or cancelled.
 *
 * CI-03 (#779 follow-up): `merge-gate` originally excluded itself on
 * `workflow_dispatch` (`if: always() && github.event_name !=
 * 'workflow_dispatch'`), which is the same skip-is-a-pass hazard one level
 * up -- a job skipped by its own `if:` still posts a "skipped" conclusion
 * under the required check name, and GitHub treats that as satisfied. The
 * "merge-gate script" describe block below does not just check substrings:
 * it extracts the job's literal `run: |` script, substitutes concrete
 * values for its `${{ }}` expressions the same way GitHub does before the
 * runner sees it, and actually executes the result with bash, asserting on
 * the real exit code for pull_request, push, workflow_dispatch, and
 * unrecognized events alike.
 *
 * No YAML parser is used here (js-yaml is present only as a transitive
 * `overrides` pin for eslint, not a direct dependency this repo can rely on
 * having types for), so job blocks are located the same way the sibling
 * ci-*.test.ts files do: by their literal 2-space-indented header line under
 * `jobs:`.
