 * phases produce: the bundle budget needs a production build, and the
 * Core Web Vitals SLA reads `.benchmark-results/benchmark-results.v1.json`,
 * which only `bench:pages` writes and which is validated against the current
 * revision. Running verify before those phases makes the SLA gate unpassable.
