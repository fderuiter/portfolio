/**
 * The workflow runs a Postgres service container published on a host port.
 * Steps that deliberately run *without* a database use a placeholder DSN, and
 * that placeholder must not land on the service's port.
 *
 * lib/db.ts drives @neondatabase/serverless over a WebSocket. Aimed at the
 * Postgres container it sends an HTTP upgrade request to a server speaking the
 * Postgres wire protocol, receives no HTTP response, and waits with no
 * handshake timeout. The build step hung for over ninety minutes this way,
 * which is invisible locally because nothing listens on 5432 there and the
 * connection is refused immediately.
