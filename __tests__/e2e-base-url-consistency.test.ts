/**
 * `playwright.config.ts` starts one web server and sets `baseURL` for every
 * project. Two specs used to override it with `test.use({ baseURL:
 * "http://localhost:3001" })`, a port nothing listens on, so every relative
 * `page.goto` inside those describe blocks failed with
 * `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` -- 42 instances in a single CI run. It went
 * unnoticed because the pipeline had never reached those specs: the build hung
 * on every earlier run, and the first two runs that got as far as Playwright
 * were cancelled before these files executed.
