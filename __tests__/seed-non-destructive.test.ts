/**
 * The seed must never destroy content that exists only in the database.
 *
 * `prisma/seed.ts` previously ran `deleteMany({})` on both content tables before
 * recreating from its payloads, commented "enforce idempotence". That does give
 * idempotence, but destructively: the seed becomes authoritative over the whole
 * table, so any row whose slug is absent from the payloads is deleted.
 *
 * Two published case studies, `equipose` and `qrcraftly`, existed in production
 * and in no source file. A seed run would have deleted both and taken two live
 * indexed URLs with them. Neon's free plan retains six hours of history and has
 * no snapshot schedule, so that loss would have been permanent in practice.
 *
 * These are source-level assertions rather than behavioural ones because
 * `prisma/seed.ts` calls `main()` at import time, so importing it from a test
 * would attempt to connect to, and write to, whatever database the developer's
 * environment points at.
