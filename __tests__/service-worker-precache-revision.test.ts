/**
 * Regression cover for the stale app shell defect (#721).
 *
 * `app/sw.ts` precached ten HTML routes with `revision: null`. In Workbox
 * derived precaching that does not mean "unversioned" -- it means "this URL
 * is already self-versioned", so `createCacheKey` uses the bare URL as the
 * cache key. That key is identical on every deployment, and
 * `Serwist.handleActivate` only deletes entries whose key is missing from the
 * current manifest, so the entry was never refreshed and never evicted. Those
 * documents were fetched once, on first install, and served from cache
 * indefinitely, embedding `/_next/static/chunks/<buildId>/...` scripts that
 * stop existing after the next deployment.
