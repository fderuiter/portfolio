/**
 * A fingerprint of this build, derived from the manifest Serwist injects.
 *
 * The app shell routes below are real HTML documents, not content-hashed
 * assets, so they need revision information. `revision: null` tells Serwist
 * the URL is already self-versioned: `createCacheKey` then uses the bare URL
 * as the cache key, identical on every deployment forever. `handleActivate`
 * only deletes cache entries whose key is absent from the current manifest,
 * and a bare URL never is -- so those documents were fetched once, on the
 * visitor's first install, and served from cache for the life of the browser
 * profile. Their embedded `/_next/static/chunks/<buildId>/...` scripts stop
 * existing after the next deployment, which is what broke the arcade in
 * production while a freshly installed origin worked fine.
 *
 * The injected manifest changes whenever any precached asset changes, so
 * hashing it gives a per-build revision with no extra build plumbing. The
 * cache key then changes every deployment: the new one is fetched on install,
 * and the previous one, no longer expected, is deleted on activate. That
 * heals visitors already holding a stale shell.
