# Portfolio UI/UX improvement backlog

Prepared 2026-09-08. This initial 32-item inventory was consolidated into 24 approved and published GitHub tickets; see [the published ticket index](ui-ux-ticket-proposal.md). It covers the public portfolio, project pages, studios, arcade, and supporting contact/authentication experiences.

## Scope and evidence

- **Observed** means seen in the initial homepage preview or reported in this session. It does not establish a defect on every route.
- **Source-supported** identifies a concrete implementation concern; the associated visual impact still needs browser verification where stated.
- **Audit required / design proposal** means work to validate or improve, not a claim that the current feature is absent or broken.
- Earlier code changes remain uncommitted. Tickets marked “draft changes exist” require review and verification before being closed.
- No additional implementation is included in this planning pass.

## Priority and sizing

- **P1:** Core professional presentation, usability, accessibility, or reliability. Address before calling the polish complete.
- **P2:** Refinement that improves clarity, personality, or depth after the foundations work.
- **S / M / L:** Relative effort, not time estimates. Split L tickets into implementation slices after their audit.
- Use `needs-triage` while scope or design choices remain open. Use `ready-for-agent` only after dependencies and acceptance criteria are settled. No P0 outage is asserted by this backlog.

## Ticket specifications

### UX-01 — Define the portfolio’s visual system and reference layouts

**Area:** Foundation · **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** M

**Evidence:** Design proposal.

**Scope:** `app/globals.css`; `components/PageLayout.tsx`.

**Problem / opportunity:** The site has an established graphite and amber palette, but page families need a shared hierarchy for type, spacing, borders, controls, and metadata.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Document tokens for surfaces, text, spacing, radii, focus, and semantic status colors; retain the architectural palette.
- [ ] Approve reference layouts for homepage, project index, case study, and studio shell at mobile and desktop sizes.

- [ ] Allow intentional code/table/canvas scrolling only within labeled, usable containers.
- [ ] Verify fixed navigation, sticky controls, toasts, and dialogs do not hide content or focus indicators.

**Depends on:** UX-02.

### UX-05 — Resolve hero crowding and establish a clear first impression

**Area:** Homepage · **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S

**Evidence:** Observed; draft changes exist.

**Scope:** `components/Hero.tsx`.

**Problem / opportunity:** The original desktop preview showed the identity badge overlapping a decorative corner label; the headline and microcopy also made the opening screen crowded.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Identity, headline, description, and primary action have distinct space at every baseline viewport.
- [ ] Explain the owner’s work and value without absolute reliability claims.
- [ ] Keep one obvious primary action and ensure the headline is readable before hydration.

**Depends on:** UX-01.

### UX-06 — Make the engineering demo responsive and keyboard accessible

**Area:** Homepage · **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** M

**Evidence:** Observed; draft changes exist.

**Scope:** `components/Hero.tsx`.

- [ ] Benchmark production builds and meet the repo’s LCP ≤ 2500ms, TTFB ≤ 800ms, and CLS ≤ 0.1 budgets; investigate outliers individually.
- [ ] Profile scroll and interaction responsiveness on mobile and remove expensive blur, layout recalculation, or unnecessary hydration where measured.
- [ ] Complete manual iOS Safari and Android checks, including large text, landscape, virtual keyboard, and safe-area behavior.

**Depends on:** UX-07, UX-22, UX-26, UX-31.

## Definition of done for implementation tickets

- Acceptance criteria pass with before/after evidence appropriate to the change.
- Changed components work at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom and expanded text.
- Keyboard focus, touch targets, reduced motion, and relevant loading/error states are checked.
- No unintended layout overflow, blocked primary actions, broken links, or new browser errors in the tested states.
- Run the repo-required quality gates and relevant tests; regenerate public API docs if contracts change.
- Do not claim comprehensive device coverage until the route/state matrix and manual device checks are complete.
