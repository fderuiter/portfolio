## Full specifications

## [UI/UX 01] Polish the homepage first impression

Published: [#574](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/574)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:01 -->

### What to build

Visitors can understand the work, read the hero immediately, and reach selected projects through a calm, responsive opening screen.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 01/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The site has an established graphite and amber palette, but page families need a shared hierarchy for type, spacing, borders, controls, and metadata. Many labels use 9–11px uppercase monospace. Dense technical styling competes with the information visitors need to read. The original desktop preview showed the identity badge overlapping a decorative corner label; the headline and microcopy also made the opening screen crowded. The hero combines measured heights, animated word wrapping, and transparent semantic overlays; their line layouts and responsive metrics can differ. The philosophy statement reserves 75–100vh and the page combines projects, skills, a long timeline, multiple contact links, and a full form.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Document tokens for surfaces, text, spacing, radii, focus, and semantic status colors; retain the architectural palette.
- [ ] Define a distinctive editorial motif based on project diagrams and real artifacts; avoid generic decorative gradients and icon grids.
- [ ] Use readable body text and reserve small monospace type for secondary metadata; do not encode essential instructions only in tiny text.
- [ ] Verify AA text contrast, control contrast, visible focus, and hover/disabled states against actual surfaces.
- [ ] Validate 200% zoom and increased text spacing without clipped content.
- [ ] Identity, headline, description, and primary action have distinct space at every baseline viewport.
- [ ] Explain the owner’s work and value without absolute reliability claims.
- [ ] Keep one obvious primary action and ensure the headline is readable before hydration.
- [ ] Compare SSR, hydration, web-font loading, and settled layouts at each baseline viewport.
- [ ] Use graphite surfaces, restrained amber/emerald/steel feedback, crisp structural borders, and a consistent editorial type and spacing scale; establish reusable styling through this working homepage slice.
- [ ] Keep one clear primary action, ensure fixed-header clearance, and verify direct section links land on visible headings.

- [ ] Keep visible text and its selectable semantic layer aligned across breakpoints and font-loading states; preserve a single meaningful accessible headline.
- [ ] Give sections a consistent spacing rhythm and keep the philosophy statement readable without excessive scroll distance or required animation.
- [ ] Validate the complete mobile path from opening headline to selected projects and contact, removing redundant transitions without removing useful content.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

### Blocked by

None (can start immediately).


## [UI/UX 02] Make the hero engineering demo usable on every input

Published: [#575](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/575)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:02 -->

### What to build

Visitors can discover and operate all three illustrative demos using touch or keyboard without clipped controls or misleading metrics.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 02/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The original demo tab strip clipped options; its long labels and status rows compete for limited card width. The original preview labeled playful messages as live telemetry and displayed absolute claims such as zero latency and bug-free inference results.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Show all three demo choices without accidental clipping; keep controls usable at 320px.
- [ ] Implement tab/panel relationships, selected state, arrow-key navigation, and appropriate focus behavior.
- [ ] Exercise every demo and reset state; prevent content collisions and disruptive height jumps.
- [ ] Identify every metric and status as measured, cached, simulated, or illustrative; remove unsupported absolute claims.
- [ ] Use real health data only when its source, scope, and freshness are available.
- [ ] Keep personality in clearly optional playful interactions without making system reliability ambiguous.
- [ ] Provide tablist/tab/tabpanel relationships, roving focus, arrow keys and Home/End behavior; verify selected panel announcements and reset feedback.
- [ ] Label demos as illustrative; do not claim a simple inference proves an application bug-free or present simulated latency as measured.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 03] Curate and polish featured project previews

Published: [#576](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/576)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:03 -->

### What to build

Visitors can scan an intentional selection of work, understand its outcomes, and follow accurate case-study links.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 03/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. Featured work currently takes the first three returned case studies. That order does not explicitly encode the strongest professional narrative. Descriptions are cut at a character count, which can end mid-word or split inline formatting; long project names dominate the cards.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Define an intentional featured selection with a clear visitor-facing reason for each project.
- [ ] Each teaser communicates problem, contribution, outcome, and an accurate destination.
- [ ] Use genuine screenshots, diagrams, or artifacts where useful; preserve a coherent fallback when assets or data are unavailable.
- [ ] Truncate at sensible text boundaries or use a tested line-based treatment with access to the complete summary.
- [ ] Ensure long titles, technology tags, and rich-text snippets cannot break card bounds.
- [ ] Align card actions while allowing text to grow at zoom; preserve full accessible link names.
- [ ] Define deterministic featured ordering without relying accidentally on database return order; verify missing project data and absent thumbnail fallbacks.
- [ ] Preserve truthful role/outcome claims; do not fabricate screenshots, metrics, testimonials, or endorsements.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 04] Simplify and verify global navigation

Published: [#577](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/577)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:04 -->

### What to build

Visitors can reach every primary destination through consistent desktop menus and a fully operable mobile drawer.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 04/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The desktop header combines route links, multiple menus, search, two persona buttons, and sound settings. Labels such as Systems and Arcade & Labs need clear grouping. The code already contains focus and Escape handling; this ticket verifies complete behavior rather than assuming it is absent.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Establish a small set of primary destinations with readable names and consistent grouping.
- [ ] Keep primary navigation usable at intermediate widths without shrinking controls excessively.
- [ ] Synchronize destination names and route coverage across header, mobile drawer, footer, search, and metadata discovery contracts.
- [ ] Test open, close, Escape, outside click, route selection, focus restoration, and background scroll locking.
- [ ] Ensure all menu content remains reachable in short landscape viewports and at 200% zoom.
- [ ] Use menu semantics only with matching keyboard behavior; keep tap targets comfortably sized.
- [ ] Verify dropdowns and drawers at short landscape heights and intermediate widths; handle Escape, outside dismissal, route selection, scroll locking, and trigger focus restoration.
- [ ] Preserve all first-class route discovery entries across navigation, search, footer, sitemap/metadata, and social previews where route labels or destinations change.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 05] Make reading-mode switching clear and predictable

Published: [#578](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/578)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:05 -->

### What to build

Visitors can choose an understandable reading mode without losing focus, position, or access to content.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 05/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. TECH and REC are terse labels for a setting that can change content and terminology across the page.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Explain each reading mode with clear visible labels or accessible help.
- [ ] Switch without losing scroll position, focus, or access to projects; avoid surprising layout jumps.
- [ ] Persist selection predictably and verify default, stored, and storage-unavailable states.
- [ ] Exercise initial SSR, hydration, stored preference, storage-unavailable, and repeated toggling; content must remain discoverable in both modes.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 06] Complete the search-to-destination journey

Published: [#579](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/579)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:06 -->

### What to build

Visitors can open search, find relevant work, recover from no results, and navigate by keyboard or touch.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 06/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. Search is a core wayfinding path and needs to feel complete for keyboard and touch users.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Verify keyboard opening, arrow navigation, Enter selection, Escape, focus restoration, and screen-reader announcements.
- [ ] Provide useful empty-query suggestions and a helpful no-results state with an easy reset.
- [ ] Keep matching, titles, previews, status labels, and destinations accurate; ensure results remain scrollable above the mobile keyboard.
- [ ] Test both Command+K and Control+K without hijacking active editing shortcuts; coordinate global search behavior with existing studio-specific omnibar scope.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

Published: [#580](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/580)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:07 -->

### What to build

Visitors can scan professional strengths and role outcomes, then reveal detail without dense, unstable layouts.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 07/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The about area contains dense biography text, codebase distribution, domain descriptions, and two timeline perspectives.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Lead with a short professional narrative and a small set of concrete strengths.
- [ ] Make role, organization, dates, and accomplishments easy to scan; preserve detail through accessible disclosure where appropriate.
- [ ] Explain what codebase-distribution data measures and avoid presenting mixed categories as equivalent programming languages.
- [ ] Preserve factual career dates and claims; separate verified outcomes from illustrative descriptions and explain code-distribution categories.
- [ ] Verify expanded/collapsed content and both timeline perspectives with long role and organization names.

### Validation and completion evidence

## [UI/UX 08] Improve case-study browsing and return navigation

Published: [#581](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/581)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:08 -->

### What to build

Visitors can browse and narrow the case-study collection, open a result, and return to their previous browsing state.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 08/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. A growing portfolio needs a clear browsing model beyond a dense feed of technical titles.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Verify or add meaningful domain/technology filters and a visible reset without introducing unnecessary controls.
- [ ] Give each entry a concise summary and consistent links to its case study, demo, and source when available.
- [ ] Maintain useful loading, no-results, and empty-data states; preserve filter state on return from a detail page.
- [ ] Cover zero results, a single result, a large collection, unavailable thumbnails, and slow data; confirm deep links and Back restore browsing context.
- [ ] Keep filter additions bounded to the actual content model; do not invent empty taxonomy or build an unrelated search service.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:09 -->

### What to build

Visitors can understand a project’s problem, contribution, decisions, and evidence, then reach its demo or related work.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 09/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The professional story should be understandable before visitors encounter implementation detail.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Use a consistent opening summary: problem, role, constraints, approach, and supported outcomes.

## [UI/UX 10] Unify contact entry points and form recovery

Published: [#583](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/583)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:10 -->

### What to build

Visitors can choose the appropriate contact action, submit valid input, understand feedback, and retry failures without losing their message.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 10/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The homepage offers a separate contact-page link, booking, social profiles, and a full contact form in the same section. The form already has validation and request states; usability depends on how those states behave together.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Choose one primary contact action and make booking and social links secondary.
- [ ] Explain what information is useful and what happens after submission without unsupported delivery promises.
- [ ] Keep the contact experience consistent between the homepage and dedicated page.
- [ ] Associate errors with fields; focus the first invalid field or error summary and retain entered values.
- [ ] Test malformed input, pending submission, duplicate clicks, network failure, rate limits, and success using mocked requests.
- [ ] Provide clear retry and success feedback without sending real messages during tests; verify autofill and mobile keyboard behavior.
- [ ] Test empty/invalid input, field associations, first-error focus, pending state, repeated clicks, server rejection, rate limits, network failure, retry, and success.
- [ ] Avoid promising delivery or response timing without evidence; preserve typed content when a submission fails.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 11] Make scheduling resilient and understandable

Published: [#584](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/584)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:11 -->

### What to build

Visitors can understand booking duration and timezone, access the booking service, or use a clear alternative if the embed fails.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 11/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. External booking and subscription flows should remain understandable when third-party resources fail or a request is rejected.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Show booking duration and timezone clearly where provided by the service.
- [ ] Provide a working fallback booking link or contact route when the embed is blocked or unavailable.
- [ ] Verify narrow screens, keyboard navigation, loading, and failure states without creating a real appointment.
- [ ] Keep external booking navigation understandable, with descriptive accessible link names and no unexpected popup dependence.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 12] Polish footer navigation and newsletter signup

Published: [#585](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/585)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:12 -->

### What to build

Visitors can find secondary destinations and subscribe with clear feedback; playful content is not mistaken for measured system health.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 12/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. External booking and subscription flows should remain understandable when third-party resources fail or a request is rejected. The original preview labeled playful messages as live telemetry and displayed absolute claims such as zero latency and bug-free inference results.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Keep secondary destinations grouped consistently with primary navigation.
- [ ] Explain newsletter content and frequency; validate and announce pending, success, duplicate, and failure states using mocked submissions.
- [ ] Separate playful ticker messages from measured status; honor reduced motion and avoid unsolicited sound.
- [ ] Avoid persistent auto-rotating messages that compete with reading; provide pause/reduced-motion behavior where needed.
- [ ] Do not duplicate the homepage contact form or imply live system monitoring from a static status label.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 13] Make loading transitions stable and accessible

Published: [#586](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/586)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:13 -->

### What to build

Visitors see a page-appropriate loading state that transitions smoothly to content with one main landmark and no inaccessible animation.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 13/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The root loading component renders a main element inside the root layout’s existing main, and uses a generic feed skeleton with a large blur layer.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Use exactly one main landmark during loading and settled rendering.
- [ ] Match skeleton geometry to the page family, avoid misleading status content, and provide a concise accessible loading indication.
- [ ] Verify slow loading, reduced motion, narrow widths, and the transition to real content without large shifts.
- [ ] Verify initial navigation and client-side navigation to homepage, case-study index/detail, and an interactive workspace under throttled loading.
- [ ] Reserve realistic geometry without rigid text heights; remove redundant main landmarks and expensive decorative loading blur.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 14] Make empty, error, offline, and missing-page states recoverable

Published: [#587](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/587)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:14 -->

### What to build

Visitors receive a clear explanation and a useful recovery action whenever a page, project, or network request is unavailable.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 14/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The homepage’s empty state currently describes the active environment and repository specifications, which is implementation detail rather than helpful visitor guidance.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Use plain explanations with appropriate retry, back, home, or contact actions.
- [ ] Keep error and offline layouts visually consistent and keyboard accessible; avoid infinite retry loops.
- [ ] Test missing projects, unavailable data, failed imports, and disconnected network states without exposing secrets or raw stack traces.
- [ ] Verify missing routes/projects, unavailable data, disconnected network, retry success and repeat failure; preserve valid user work.
- [ ] Present useful visitor language rather than active-environment, repository, stack trace, or implementation details.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.

## [UI/UX 15] Isolate authentication from public portfolio journeys

Published: [#588](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/588)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:15 -->

### What to build

Public visitors never depend on Clerk’s browser SDK; admin users retain protected access and a working login resource policy.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 15/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. The preview displayed Clerk script errors on the public homepage. The existing CSP omitted Clerk sources; provider isolation and CSP corrections have been drafted but need final verification.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Public pages render and remain interactive without downloading the Clerk browser SDK.
- [ ] Admin login loads its required resources under a narrowly configured CSP and retains server-side access protection.
- [ ] Verify the reported server-action error independently; distinguish stale local server failures from reproducible application defects.
- [ ] Review the existing uncommitted provider-isolation and CSP drafts before implementing; they are not verified production fixes.
- [ ] Reproduce the reported Clerk resource failure and unexpected server-action response separately. Confirm response status/content type and distinguish stale development state from application defects.
- [ ] Allow only the configured authentication origin and necessary supporting resources in CSP; retain all authorization and security-header protections.
- [ ] Prove public rendering and interaction with Clerk resources unavailable, and prove admin login loads correctly when its resources are reachable; use mocks for destructive or sensitive flows.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

Published: [#589](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/589)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:16 -->

### What to build

Visitors can open a guided proof, make an inference, inspect feedback, and reset or share supported state with clear keyboard and mobile behavior.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 16/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Demonstrate this complete journey: Visitors can open a guided proof, make an inference, inspect feedback, and reset or share supported state with clear keyboard and mobile behavior.
- [ ] Provide a useful example, clear first action, contextual help, and an obvious return to the portfolio.
- [ ] Verify responsive panel behavior, keyboard focus, touch inputs, and accessible canvas descriptions where applicable.
- [ ] Document supported persistence/share/export behavior; provide clear reset or recovery actions without unexpectedly discarding work.
- [ ] Keep local studio theme changes scoped to the workspace and test stored or URL-synchronized preferences where supported.
- [ ] Use a known valid premise/inference example and a deliberate invalid step; verify both feedback paths and no silent loss on reset or navigation.
- [ ] Keep proof evaluation semantics unchanged unless an independently reproduced defect requires the repository’s red-green remediation protocol.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.

Published: [#590](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/590)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:17 -->

### What to build

Visitors can load a sample clinical form, edit and validate a field, inspect feedback, and preserve or export supported work without losing their place.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 17/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

Related: #536 and its CRF revamp issues (including #544). Coordinate presentation work; do not duplicate their new feature scope. These are context links, not blockers.

### Acceptance criteria

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 18/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

## [UI/UX 20] Polish arcade discovery and launch expectations

Published: [#593](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/593)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:20 -->

### What to build

Visitors can choose a cabinet with clear purpose and input requirements and reach a predictable launch screen.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 20/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. Novel games should be easy to start without needing to infer controls or understand the underlying engine.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

Related: #549, the arcade lifecycle and HUD architecture epic. Reuse its contracts; this ticket covers visitor-facing polish, not a parallel engine migration. It is context, not an additional blocker.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each game exposes purpose, controls, supported input, launch, pause/reset, and a clear return route.
- [ ] Verify launch/warmup, loading failure, game-over, retry, and touch layouts for every cabinet.
- [ ] Provide canvas descriptions and keyboard alternatives where feasible; explain genuine input limitations before launch.
- [ ] Cover every cabinet in the existing arcade inventory; present purpose and supported input consistently, with a fallback for unsupported devices.
- [ ] Reuse the established cabinet launch and warmup workflow; this ticket does not replace the engine lifecycle architecture.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.

## [UI/UX 21] Polish Laser Loon and Quasi-Puzzler play sessions

Published: [#594](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/594)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:21 -->

### What to build

Visitors can launch, understand controls, play, restart, and return from these two cabinets without clipped overlays or lost focus.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 21/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

Related: #549, the arcade lifecycle and HUD architecture epic. Reuse its contracts; this ticket covers visitor-facing polish, not a parallel engine migration. It is context, not an additional blocker.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Demonstrate this complete journey: Visitors can launch, understand controls, play, restart, and return from these two cabinets without clipped overlays or lost focus.
- [ ] Document supported input and controls before launch; verify loading/warmup, active play, and exit states for each named experience.
- [ ] Verify pause, restart, game-over, and error recovery where applicable; provide keyboard and touch controls or clear input limitations.
- [ ] Ensure timers, animation, and sound stop appropriately on exit; honor reduced motion where possible without hiding required game feedback.
- [ ] Record a separate launch→play→reset/retry→exit checklist and mobile/desktop evidence for both Laser Loon and Quasi-Puzzler.
- [ ] Preserve each game’s mechanics; changes are limited to its presentation, control discoverability, HUD, feedback, and shell lifecycle.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.

## [UI/UX 23] Polish Retro Labyrinth, Working With Duck, and Meme Vault sessions

Published: [#596](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/596)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:23 -->

### What to build

Visitors can enter each experience, understand its available interactions, recover or restart where supported, and return to the arcade.

**Priority:** P2. **Approved slice:** 23/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it.

## [UI/UX 24] Validate the complete portfolio across devices and access needs

Published: [#597](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/597)

<!-- portfolio-ui-polish-2026-09 ticket:24 -->

### What to build

The polished journeys have reproducible browser evidence and a recorded real-device accessibility and performance sign-off, with remaining defects explicitly tracked.

**Priority:** P1. **Approved slice:** 24/24.

### Context and scope

This is an audit-and-polish slice, not a claim that all current controls are defective. Confirm existing behavior before changing it. A guarantee of visual consistency requires a reproducible inventory; only the homepage has been visually inspected during this session. Existing defensive classes and tests provide a foundation, but browser measurements must verify the rendered result. Existing skip links, announcers, and focus utilities need end-to-end verification across page and overlay states. The site combines entrance animations, scroll effects, grid animation, rotating status text, and playful audio interactions. Static class assertions do not prove that the final browser layout is intact; the repo already has browser probes to extend. Visual polish includes fast initial content, responsive controls, and stable layouts on actual devices.

Keep this slice independently demoable. Preserve existing behavior that already satisfies the criteria and avoid unrelated architectural changes. Earlier local drafts, where present, must be reviewed and tested rather than assumed complete.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Capture the complete public route/state matrix with deterministic data in Chromium and WebKit, including representative dynamic case studies.
- [ ] Run keyboard and screen-reader journeys plus axe; resolve or ticket every critical, serious, or moderate finding.
- [ ] Verify mobile text expansion, 200% zoom, long content, landscape, safe areas, and virtual keyboards; require human sign-off for real iOS/Android checks unavailable to automation.
- [ ] Benchmark production builds against repository LCP, TTFB, and CLS budgets; record individual outliers.
- [ ] Confirm all prior issues meet their own acceptance criteria and publish a clear remaining-defect list rather than claiming untested perfection.
- [ ] Include the complete public route inventory, including Stack, standalone contact/scheduling, alternate Neuro entry points, offline/missing routes, both reading modes, and representative project details; verify no first-class page is omitted.
- [ ] Record browser versions, tested devices, fixed defects and residual issues. Cross-browser automation does not count as physical-device sign-off.
- [ ] Require zero unresolved critical, serious, or moderate axe violations for release acceptance; defects discovered here must be fixed or explicitly retain this ticket as incomplete.
- [ ] Meet production-build LCP ≤ 2500ms, TTFB ≤ 800ms and CLS ≤ 0.1 budgets; do not substitute development timings or stale reports.
- [ ] Individual tickets perform their own validation before closure; this dependent ticket is final integration sign-off, not a reason to postpone testing.

### Validation and completion evidence

- [ ] Validate the entire changed journey at 320px, 375px, 768px, and 1440px, plus 200% zoom, 40% text expansion, and long unbroken content; no unintended horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, clipped controls, or obscured focus.
- [ ] Verify keyboard-only operation, logical focus order, visible focus, accessible names and state announcements, readable WCAG AA contrast, and touch targets of at least 44×44 CSS px for primary controls; do not rely on color or hover alone.
- [ ] Honor reduced motion and preserve readable content before hydration; keep sound opt-in. Validate relevant loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states.
- [ ] Use deterministic fixtures and mock outbound contact/newsletter/booking operations during testing; do not send real messages, subscriptions, or appointments.
- [ ] Preserve existing capabilities, supported persistence, local studio theme scoping, canonical links, and server-side access protection. No backend or public API change unless required by this visitor journey.
- [ ] Attach before/after screenshots and a concise interaction test record identifying viewport, browser, scenario, and result; add meaningful regression coverage for changed behavior.
- [ ] Run the repository-required quality checks and relevant tests; regenerate documentation if public contracts change. Report any failing gate or unverified device explicitly rather than claiming complete coverage.
