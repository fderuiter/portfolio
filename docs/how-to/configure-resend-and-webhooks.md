# How-To: Configure Resend and Webhooks

Goal: get transactional email (contact form replies, newsletter
confirmations, case-study feedback alerts) and the inbound Resend
deliverability webhook working locally or in a new deployment environment.
See [ADR 0018](../../adr/0018-resilient-transactional-email-and-bot-defense.md)
and [ADR 0024](../../adr/0024-resilient-resend-webhook-deliverability-and-outbound-retry-queue.md)
for the design rationale behind the retry queue and bounce/complaint
handling this configuration enables. See the
[integration catalog](../reference/integrations-catalog.md) for how Resend
fits alongside this project's other external integrations, and
[how-to: configure Clerk, Sentry, Upstash, Vercel Cron/Analytics, and GitHub data fetching](configure-integrations.md)
for the rest of them.

## 1. Set the required environment variables

These three keys are declared in [`lib/env.ts`](../../lib/env.ts) and
mirrored in `.env.example`:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=""
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_example_secret_key"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Your Name <notifications@yourdomain.com>"
```

- **`RESEND_API_KEY`**: from the [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys).
  Live transmission is allowed only when the application runs as Production.
  Development and Preview always use simulated delivery even if a key is
  accidentally attached. Tests exercise a mocked transport with an explicit
  `re_test_` fixture key and never contact Resend.
- **`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`**: must be a verified sending address/domain in
  your Resend account, or sends will be rejected.
- **`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`**: the signing secret Resend gives you when you
  create a webhook endpoint (see step 3). It's a Svix signing secret
  (`whsec_...`), not a Resend API key.

Validate the file against the declared contract:

```bash
npm run env:check
```

## 2. Understand what the webhook receiver does

[`app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts`](../../app/api/webhooks/resend/route.ts)
receives Resend's deliverability events (bounces, complaints, delivery
confirmations). It:

1. Requires all three Svix signature headers (`svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`,
   `svix-signature`) — a request missing any of them is rejected with 400.
2. Verifies the signature via
   [`verifySvixSignature`](../../lib/services/email-service.ts) against
   `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` before parsing the body at all — an invalid
   signature is rejected with 401.
3. Parses and validates the JSON payload against `ResendWebhookEventSchema`
   in `lib/schemas.ts` — a payload that doesn't match is rejected with 422.

Because signature verification happens before JSON parsing, a webhook
misconfigured with the wrong secret fails fast and visibly rather than
silently accepting unverified events.

### Event selection

Only `email.bounced` and `email.complained` trigger a suppression-list
write (`EmailService.recordSuppression`). Every other subscribed event type
(`email.sent`, `email.delivered`, `email.delivery_delayed`, `email.opened`,
`email.clicked`) is accepted and acknowledged (`handled: true`) but has no
side effect — there is currently no delivery-analytics store for them.

### Retry and duplicate-delivery semantics

The route acknowledges an event with `200` only once it is durably
processed. If the suppression-list write throws (database outage, connection
drop, etc.), `EmailService.handleWebhookEvent` returns `{ handled: false }`
and the route responds `500` instead of `200` — Resend/Svix treat any non-2xx
response as a delivery failure and retry with backoff, so the event is not
lost.

A legitimate redelivery (Svix retrying after a prior non-2xx, or Resend
sending a genuine duplicate) is never rejected outright — the route does not
attempt to detect "have I seen this `svix-id` before" and short-circuit. Instead,
`recordSuppression` is an idempotent upsert keyed by the recipient's email
address, so replaying the same `email.bounced`/`email.complained` event any
number of times converges on the same suppression-list state rather than
creating duplicate rows or duplicate side effects. This also means a batch
event with multiple recipients is safe to fully retry after a partial
failure: recipients already written are simply re-upserted as a no-op, and
only the recipient that previously failed changes state.

This is a deliberate simplification for this Hobby-tier deployment: it trades
a dedicated processed-event-ID ledger (which would let a duplicate be
detected and skipped without re-touching the database at all) for relying on
upsert idempotency, since a second write to the same suppression row is
already both safe and cheap here.

### Suppression-check failure policy

`EmailService.isSuppressed` (the *read* path, consulted before every
outbound send) fails **open** on a database error — it returns
`{ suppressed: false }` rather than blocking the send. This is intentional:
a transient outage on the read path should not stop all outbound mail. It is
asymmetric with the *write* path above on purpose — a suppression-list write
failure must never be silently accepted, because losing it means a
bounced/complained address could keep receiving mail indefinitely.

### Secret rotation

Only a single active `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is supported. There is no
overlap window for verifying against both an old and a new secret during
rotation — rotating the secret in the Resend dashboard and updating the
environment variable must happen together, or verification will fail for
requests signed with whichever secret is not currently configured.

### Durable outbound retry safety

The daily unified maintenance route leases at most five due queue rows before
dispatching them. An overlapping invocation can lease each row only once; if a
worker stops unexpectedly, its five-minute lease expires and the row becomes
eligible again. Every retry uses `portfolio-email-<queue-id>` as the Resend
idempotency key, so an ambiguous timeout and later retry converge on one
provider send. Failures use capped exponential backoff with deterministic
jitter, recheck the suppression list immediately before dispatch, and retain
structured tags without logging message bodies.

## 3. Register the webhook endpoint with Resend

In the Resend dashboard, add a webhook endpoint pointing at:

```text
https://<your-deployed-domain>/api/webhooks/resend
```

Resend will generate a signing secret for that endpoint — copy it into
`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Locally, you'll need a tunnel (e.g. an `ngrok`-style
forwarding URL) pointing at `npm run dev`'s port if you want to receive real
webhook deliveries against your local environment; otherwise, test the
route directly (see step 4).

## 4. Test the webhook locally without a live tunnel

Because signature verification is a pure function of the raw body and the
three Svix headers, you can construct a valid signed request in a test or a
local script using the same secret your `.env.local` declares, without
needing Resend to actually deliver anything. Follow
[`__tests__/resend-webhook.test.ts`](../../__tests__/resend-webhook.test.ts)
for the exact signing scheme
(`${svixId}.${svixTimestamp}.${payload}`, HMAC over that string) and for
worked examples of both a valid and a tampered signature.

## 5. Confirm the full flow

```bash
npm run dev
```

Submit the contact form (or trigger a newsletter subscription) locally and
check the server logs for the simulated-send confirmation. Local development
never transmits. Live delivery and bounce/complaint verification must be done
from the protected Production environment with an approved synthetic
recipient; confirm the event round-trips through the webhook route without a
400/401/422 and retain only secret-redacted evidence.

Before closing the provider configuration gate, an operator must verify the
Production sending domain and sender, register the canonical
`https://deruiter.dev/api/webhooks/resend` endpoint with the intended event
types, scope the API and webhook secrets to Production, and confirm Preview has
no transmitting path. These dashboard actions cannot be inferred from source
code or automated without the protected account credentials.
