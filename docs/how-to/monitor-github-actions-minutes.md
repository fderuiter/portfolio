# Monitor GitHub Actions Minutes

Last verified: 2026-09-24 against GitHub repository metadata and current
workflow configuration. The repository is public; standard hosted-runner
minutes are free for public repositories.

Governing policy: [ADR 0039](../../adr/0039-github-pro-plan-capabilities-and-actions-minutes-governance.md).

## Why this exists

The repository is public, so standard GitHub-hosted runner minutes are free.
Keep using standard runner labels: larger runners are billable, and artifact
and cache storage have separate limits. Workflow timeouts, bounded device
coverage, and avoiding duplicate gating runs remain important operational
controls. On 2026-09-13 the previous single-job `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
design (full four-device Playwright matrix on every PR push, repeated
identically on the post-merge `main` push) exhausted the private-repository
allowance during one active day of iteration. #733 restructured the workflow
to reduce duplicate and unnecessary work. This page tracks workflow usage,
storage, and run duration, mirroring
[monitor-vercel-headroom.md](./monitor-vercel-headroom.md).

**Correction 2026-09-18:** this page previously stated that Actions billing
usage was not readable through the API and that checking it was a dashboard
action. That is wrong. The enhanced billing endpoint reads it directly, given
a token carrying the `user` scope (`gh auth refresh -h github.com -s user`):

```bash
gh api "/users/fderuiter/settings/billing/usage?year=2026&month=9"
```

The legacy `/settings/billing/actions` endpoint now returns `410 Gone` and
must not be used.

Two properties of the response matter and are easy to get wrong:

- **Only private repositories draw on the allowance.** Public repositories
  appear in the same response with their minutes fully discounted. Summing
  every `usageItems` entry overstates consumption several-fold — September
  2026 totalled 19,955 minutes across all repositories but only 2,433
  against the allowance. Filter by private repositories before summing.
- **`netAmount` is not a usage signal.** It stays `0.00` both when usage is
  comfortably inside the allowance and when the allowance is exhausted with
  a $0 spending limit, because in the latter case GitHub refuses the jobs
  rather than billing them. Measure `quantity` against the allowance; do not
  infer headroom from cost.

## Check before a heavy iteration day

Before merging or dispatching anything expected to trigger several CI runs in
one day (a run of follow-up PRs, several `workflow_dispatch` cross-device
runs, repeated pushes while chasing a flaky test):

1. Open **Settings → Billing → Actions minutes** for the account owning
   `fderuiter/portfolio` (organization or personal account billing settings,
   whichever holds this repository).
2. Confirm standard GitHub-hosted runners remain selected. Public-repository
   runner minutes are free; larger runners and artifact/cache storage may
   still incur costs or hit separate limits.
3. Prefer `heavy-gate`'s single-device PR run over dispatching
   `cross-device-matrix` unless the change specifically needs the full matrix.
   Validate speculative fixes locally first (`npm run typecheck && npm run
   lint && npx playwright test --project=chromium <file>`).
4. Review run duration and storage independently of minutes; the free standard
   runner allowance does not make an unbounded job or artifact accumulation
   operationally safe.

## What changed to reduce cost (ADR 0039 / #733)

- `fast-gate` (typecheck, lint, docs/schema drift, unit tests, property
  fuzzing) runs on `main` pushes and pull requests targeting `main` —
  cheap, and gates the expensive jobs below via `needs:`.
- `security-gate` (vulnerability audit) runs on `main` pushes and pull requests
  targeting `main` — independent and fast.
- `heavy-gate` (build, bundle budget, Playwright, Web Vitals) runs only on
  PR pushes, and only against the `chromium` Playwright project instead of
  all four configured device projects.
- `device-gate` runs only on PR pushes, alongside `heavy-gate`, and runs the
  two genuinely device-engine-dependent specs (`visual.spec.ts`,
  `touch-controls.spec.ts`) against the three non-chromium projects —
  coverage `heavy-gate`'s single `chromium` project does not have. This used
  to be a separate `post-merge-device-smoke` job that ran only after a
  squash-merge landed on `main` (see CI-02 below); it does not repeat the
  full suite a second time on identical code.
- `merge-gate` is a required-checks summary job: it `needs:` every job above
  and fails deliberately unless each one that is supposed to run for the
  triggering event actually reported success. See the [required check
  contract](#required-check-contract-for-branch-protection-732) below.
- `cross-device-matrix` (the full four-device matrix against the full suite)
  is `workflow_dispatch`-only, for a release or a device-sensitive change
  that specifically warrants it.
- The current one-time Jules consolidation PR targets `main` and uses the same
  required pre-merge gates as other changes. After it lands, new feature work
  continues to target `main`; the temporary `dev` branch is not a CI target
  (see [ADR 0050](../../adr/0050-jules-consolidation-release.md)).

## CI-02: targeted device coverage gates pull requests to `main`

Before this change, `device-gate` was `post-merge-device-smoke`: it ran only
on the `push` to `main` after a squash-merge, so a device-engine regression
(a pixel-diff drift or a touch-only interaction bug) could land on `main`
before anything caught it — the PR's own `heavy-gate` run only exercised
`chromium`. `device-gate` now runs on the pull request itself, alongside
`heavy-gate`, so both the full-suite `chromium` run and the targeted
`Tablet Safari` / `Mobile Safari` / `Mobile Chrome` run of `visual.spec.ts`
and `touch-controls.spec.ts` gate the merge. Nothing now re-runs that
targeted suite a second time on the post-merge push — the reduced-scope
split from #733/#775 (one four-device matrix run per merge, not per push and
per PR) is unchanged, just relocated to before the merge instead of after.

`main`-push confirmation stays deliberately bounded to `fast-gate` and
`security-gate` — a safety net for a direct push that bypasses PR review.
Branch protection is available for this public repository, but its current
dashboard configuration has not been verified; #732 tracks that human check.
The bounded push jobs are not a repeat of the build/Playwright work the merged
PR already did. The full
four-device matrix remains a one-click `workflow_dispatch` job
(`cross-device-matrix`); nothing here changes when or how often that runs
automatically (it doesn't).

### Required check contract for branch protection (#732)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` exposes one job whose sole purpose is to be the
required status check: **`Merge Gate (Required Checks Summary)`** (the
`merge-gate` job's `name:`). Require exactly that check for `main` under
Settings → Branches → branch protection → "Require status checks to pass
before merging". The current rules remain unverified because the connected
GitHub API integration cannot read branch-protection settings; #732 tracks
dashboard verification. The `dev` → `main` consolidation PR is gated on the
same `main` rule.

This replaces the two check names #732 originally listed
(`Rigor Ecosystem (Logic, Visual, Performance)` and
`Security Gate (Vulnerability Audit)`) — the first no longer exists under
that name since #775 split it into `fast-gate`/`heavy-gate`/`device-gate`.
Requiring the individual job names directly does not work correctly here:
`heavy-gate` and `device-gate` both carry an `if: github.event_name ==
'pull_request'` condition, and GitHub's required-status-checks rule treats a
job skipped by its own `if:` (or skipped as a side effect of a failed
`needs:` predecessor) the same as a job that never applied — a "skipped"
conclusion satisfies the requirement instead of blocking it. `merge-gate`
runs with `if: always()` specifically to stay unaffected by that, then
inspects `needs.<job>.result` for every job that should have run for the
current event and fails unless each one is literally `"success"` — so a
cancelled Playwright run, a failed `fast-gate`, or an unexpectedly skipped
`device-gate` cannot produce a passing `merge-gate`, and requiring that one
check is sufficient; requiring the four upstream jobs individually as well
is redundant (harmless, but adds nothing `merge-gate` doesn't already
depend on).

`security-gate` remains unconditional (no `if:`), so its `"Security Gate
(Vulnerability Audit)"` check name is safe to require directly as well if the
repo owner wants defense-in-depth beyond `merge-gate` alone — but `merge-gate`
failing already implies `security-gate` failed or was skipped, so it is not
required for correctness.

### CI-03: manual (`workflow_dispatch`) and unrecognized triggers now fail closed

`merge-gate` originally carried `if: always() && github.event_name !=
'workflow_dispatch'` at the job level. That exclusion made the *entire job*
skip on a manual dispatch. Understanding why this matters requires examining
how GitHub evaluates required status checks on pull requests versus head commits,
as documented in official GitHub guidance on
[Troubleshooting required status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/merge-and-close-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks):

1. **Test-merge versus head check evaluation**: When a pull request triggers a
   workflow via `pull_request`, GitHub creates a temporary test merge commit
   (`refs/pull/<number>/merge`). GitHub displays "Showing checks for the merge
   commit" in the pull request status checks box, and the checks associated with
   that test merge commit determine whether the PR can be merged. GitHub only
   falls back to evaluating checks reported on the head commit SHA if no checks
   exist for the test merge commit. A check run reported on the head commit does
   not unconditionally overwrite or replace an existing test-merge check run.
2. **Evaluated event scopes**: GitHub evaluates workflow jobs for pull request
   status checks only when triggered by specific events: `push`, `pull_request`,
   `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_target`, `deployment`, or `deployment_status`.
   Checks created by `workflow_dispatch` do not appear in the pull request's
   status checks section and cannot satisfy a required status check in a branch ruleset.
3. **The genuine skip-is-a-pass hazard**: If `merge-gate` were skipped via `if:`,
   GitHub would report its conclusion as "skipped". In any evaluation context
   where checks are assessed against a commit directly (such as direct branch pushes
   or head-check fallback when merge checks are absent), GitHub's required-status-checks
   rule treats "skipped" as satisfied rather than blocking. That could allow an
   unsupported trigger to post a passing conclusion without validating requirements.

To eliminate this gap, `merge-gate` runs unconditionally (`if: always()`, no
event exclusion), and its shell script dispatches explicitly on `github.event_name`:

- `pull_request`: requires all four predecessor jobs (`fast-gate`, `security-gate`,
  `heavy-gate`, `device-gate`) to report literal `"success"`.
- `push`: requires `fast-gate` and `security-gate` only (the bounded main-push
  confirmation, since PR review already validated heavy-gate and device-gate).
- `*` (default): any other event — `workflow_dispatch` included, and any future
  trigger this workflow does not yet have — hits an explicit default branch that
  fails the job outright (`echo "::error::..."; fail=1`).

A manual or unrecognized trigger can therefore never produce a "skipped" conclusion
(satisfied by default) or an accidental "success" for this required check name.

### Implementation evidence, server settings, and runtime measurements

The private-repository minutes outage described in older revisions ended as a
current constraint when the repository became public on 2026-09-23. This
section records the historical outage separately from controls that still
need verification:

- **Local implementation evidence**: Workflow YAML topology, step dependencies
  (`needs:`), and the literal bash evaluation logic of `merge-gate` are verified
  locally by offline unit and shell execution test suites
  (`__tests__/ci-execution-policy.test.ts` and `__tests__/ci-gate-ordering.test.ts`).
  These tests extract the exact bash script from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
  execute it across simulated event and status permutations (`pull_request`,
  `push`, `workflow_dispatch`, `success`, `failure`, `cancelled`, `skipped`).
- **Server-side protection is available but unverified**: GitHub currently
  reports this repository as public. The connected API integration returned
  `403` when asked to read branch-protection settings, so #732 tracks manual
  confirmation. Client-side guardrails remain defense-in-depth. Since
  [ADR 0049](../../adr/0049-deploy-main-on-green-ci.md), no GitHub workflow or
  environment deploys: Vercel builds and promotes `main` itself.
- **Runtime measurements**: The `timeout-minutes` values on `fast-gate` (20),
  `security-gate` (15), `heavy-gate` (40), `device-gate` (25), and `merge-gate` (5)
  remain upper bounds, not measured runtimes. Review successful GitHub run
  durations before tightening them; standard public-runner minutes are free,
  while larger runners and artifact/cache storage have separate billing.
- **Historical outage**: The private-repository allowance was exhausted in
  September 2026. On 2026-09-22, the then-current `main`, PR #886, and scheduled
  synthetic-probe runs failed with zero executed steps. The repository became
  public on 2026-09-23, so this is no longer a reason to stop or defer GitHub
  Actions runs. Check current run results after each release update; Vercel
  preview availability is tracked separately.
