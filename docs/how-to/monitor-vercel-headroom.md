# Monitor Vercel Storage and Build Headroom

Documentation last reconciled: 2026-09-22. Meter data last verified:

Governing policy: [ADR 0036](../../adr/0036-free-tier-offloading-and-provider-quota-governance.md),
[Issue #691](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/691), closed
[Issue #692](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/692), and
[Issue #698](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/698).

## Inspect Headroom

```bash
npm run headroom:vercel
npm run headroom:vercel -- --json
npm run headroom:vercel -- --ledger
npm run headroom:vercel -- --strict
npm run inventory:vercel
```

`--strict` exits unsuccessfully while any meter is critical. These commands
evaluate the checked-in 2026-09-12 snapshot; they do not query Vercel live.
The strict command currently fails because the captured Functions Storage
meter was critical. That failure is not proof of today's value, and a pass
after editing the snapshot would not be provider evidence.

## Thresholds and Captured Snapshot

| Meter | Limit | Warning | Critical | 2026-09-12 usage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Functions Storage | 10.00 GB | 8.00 GB | 9.50 GB | **9.68 GB** |
| Deployment Storage | 10.00 GB | 8.00 GB | 9.50 GB | **6.20 GB** |
| Build Time | 100.0 hours | 80.0 hours | 95.0 hours | **87.0 hours** |

- Healthy: below 80%.
- Warning: at least 80% and below 95%.
- Critical: at least 95%.
- Stale: the snapshot exceeds the configured maximum age.
- Unreadable: a provider value is missing or malformed; never interpret it as
  zero.

`HeadroomAlertManager` fingerprints alerts by resource and severity, applies a
cooldown, and emits a recovery notification when a resource returns to a
healthy band.

> [!CAUTION]
> `scripts/vercel-headroom.ts` currently defaults its evaluation clock to a
> fixed 2026-09-12 timestamp. Its `stale` classification therefore does not
> age naturally when the command is run later. Until the implementation is
> corrected, compare the capture timestamp above with the real current date
> and treat an over-age snapshot as stale manually.

## Critical Functions Storage Response

The 2026-09-12 cleanup removed 57 superseded deployments and closed
Issue #692. The GB-month meter may remain at 9.68 GB until its rolling accounting and
recovery state reconcile.

When the meter is critical:

1. Keep automatic Git deployments disabled until 2026-10-01 per
   [ADR 0051](../../adr/0051-manual-production-releases.md). On October 1,
   restore `main`-only Production deployment under ADR 0049 unless a new
   decision is recorded.
2. Open the Vercel usage dashboard, select All Projects and Last 30 Days, and
   record all three meter values with a UTC timestamp.
3. Run a fresh paginated deployment and alias inventory.
4. Compare the result with
   [the retention inventory](../reference/vercel-retention-inventory.md).
5. Preserve current production, the immediately previous known-good
   production deployment, aliased targets, active reviews, and provider
   retention exceptions.
6. If new candidates remain, put their exact IDs and protection evidence in a
   new human-gated issue. A prior deletion approval is not reusable.
7. After approved deletion, verify the canonical domain and record the meter
   over subsequent days. Escalate to Vercel support if usage keeps increasing
   while successful deployment creation remains bounded.

## Warning Build-Time Response

1. During the temporary hold, confirm `vercel.json` sets
   `git.deploymentEnabled` to `false`. On 2026-10-01, restore the `main`-only
   allowlist (`"*": false, "main": true`).
2. Confirm no GitHub Action, Deploy Hook, or second integration also deploys
   the same commit.
3. Keep one Production build per accepted pull request, started manually from
   the current `main` SHA during the hold; use an on-demand preview only when
   deployed review materially reduces risk.
4. Review failed and canceled build frequency before changing retention.

## Refresh the Audited Snapshot

First establish read-only provider access. On 2026-09-22 the workstation's
global Vercel CLI (`41.6.1`) rejected its stored token, and the connected
Vercel app returned `403` for the linked team. Do not use
`.vercel/.env.production.local` as a token source; it contains sensitive
production configuration and no usable `VERCEL_TOKEN`.

After reauthorization, read the live dashboard and deployment API without
printing environment values. Confirm meter values, the canonical alias target,
the current/previous known-good deployments, recent errors, and retention
exceptions. Then update together:

- `scripts/vercel-headroom.ts`;
- `scripts/vercel-retention-inventory.ts`;
- this guide;
- `docs/reference/vercel-retention-inventory.md`;
- their focused tests.

Then run:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/vercel-headroom.test.ts __tests__/vercel-retention-inventory.test.ts
npm run lint:docs
```

Do not deploy while the last-known Functions Storage reading is critical and
the live meter is unavailable. The
[2026-09-22 readiness audit](../explanation/audits/2026-09-22-release-public-vercel-readiness.md)
records the authorization gap and public production evidence.

## Provider Ledger

The same ledger tracks the free-tier boundaries recorded in ADR 0036 for
Vercel, Neon, Upstash, Resend, Clerk, and Sentry. An unavailable live meter is
recorded as unknown. The ledger is a governance aid, not proof that an
integration is connected; use the live integration and environment audit in
the [GitHub–Vercel governance report](../explanation/audits/2026-09-12-github-vercel-release-governance.md)
before enabling a provider in Preview or Production.
