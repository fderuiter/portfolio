# Monitor Vercel Storage and Build Headroom

[Issue #691](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/691), closed

## Inspect Headroom

```bash
npm run headroom:vercel
npm run headroom:vercel -- --json
npm run headroom:vercel -- --ledger
npm run headroom:vercel -- --strict
npm run inventory:vercel
```

`--strict` exits unsuccessfully while any meter is critical. These commands
evaluate the checked-in verified snapshot; they do not query Vercel live.

## Thresholds and Current Snapshot

| Meter | Limit | Warning | Critical | Verified usage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Functions Storage | 10.00 GB | 8.00 GB | 9.50 GB | **9.68 GB** |
| Deployment Storage | 10.00 GB | 8.00 GB | 9.50 GB | **6.20 GB** |
| Build Time | 100.0 hours | 80.0 hours | 95.0 hours | **87.0 hours** |

- Healthy: below 80%.
- Warning: at least 80% and below 95%.
- Critical: at least 95%.
- Stale: the snapshot exceeds the configured maximum age.
- Unreadable: a provider value is missing or malformed; never interpret it as
  zero.

`HeadroomAlertManager` fingerprints alerts by resource and severity, applies a
cooldown, and emits a recovery notification when a resource returns to a
healthy band.

## Critical Functions Storage Response

The 2026-09-12 cleanup removed 57 superseded deployments and closed
Issue #692. The GB-month meter may remain at 9.68 GB until its rolling accounting and
recovery state reconcile.

When the meter is critical:

1. Keep automatic non-production deployments disabled.
2. Open the Vercel usage dashboard, select All Projects and Last 30 Days, and
   record all three meter values with a UTC timestamp.
3. Run a fresh paginated deployment and alias inventory.
4. Compare the result with
   [the retention inventory](../reference/vercel-retention-inventory.md).
5. Preserve current production, the immediately previous known-good
   production deployment, aliased targets, active reviews, and provider
   retention exceptions.
6. If new candidates remain, put their exact IDs and protection evidence in a
   new human-gated issue. A prior deletion approval is not reusable.
7. After approved deletion, verify the canonical domain and record the meter
   over subsequent days. Escalate to Vercel support if usage keeps increasing
   while successful deployment creation remains bounded.

## Warning Build-Time Response

1. Confirm Vercel Git deployments are allowlisted to `main` in `vercel.json`.
2. Confirm no GitHub Action, Deploy Hook, or second integration also deploys
   the same commit.
3. Keep one production build per accepted pull request and use an on-demand
   preview only when deployed review materially reduces risk.
4. Review failed and canceled build frequency before changing retention.

## Refresh the Audited Snapshot

After reading the live dashboard and deployment API, update together:

- `scripts/vercel-headroom.ts`;
- `scripts/vercel-retention-inventory.ts`;
- this guide;
- `docs/reference/vercel-retention-inventory.md`;
- their focused tests.

Then run:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/vercel-headroom.test.ts __tests__/vercel-retention-inventory.test.ts
npm run lint:docs
```

## Provider Ledger

The same ledger tracks the free-tier boundaries recorded in ADR 0036 for
Vercel, Neon, Upstash, Resend, Clerk, and Sentry. An unavailable live meter is
recorded as unknown. The ledger is a governance aid, not proof that an
integration is connected; use the live integration and environment audit in
the [GitHub–Vercel governance report](../explanation/audits/2026-09-12-github-vercel-release-governance.md)
before enabling a provider in Preview or Production.
