Scope: the operational consequences assessed before changing
`fderuiter/portfolio` from private to public on GitHub Free. The visibility
change is complete; the historical gate and evidence below remain useful for
understanding the decision and the remaining post-publication work.

## Decision Summary

Making the repository public removes the private-repository monthly compute
minute ceiling for **standard** GitHub-hosted runners. GitHub describes those
runners as free and unlimited for public repositories. It does not make all
Actions usage free: larger runners remain billable, while artifact and cache
storage retain separate allowances and billing behavior.

At the time of the 2026-09-22 snapshot, the visibility decision was gated on
the credential concern tracked in
[#865](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/865) and review of the
repository, Git history, GitHub discussion surfaces, and historical Actions
logs and artifacts. The repository became public on 2026-09-23. Current
post-publication controls and any remaining operator checks are tracked in
[#732](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/732) and
[#863](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/863); public secret
scanning remains a useful backstop, not proof that every application-specific
secret pattern is covered.

## Actions Billing Findings

- GitHub provides free, unlimited standard GitHub-hosted runners for public
  repositories. Public conversion should therefore remove the 2,000-minute
  GitHub Free compute constraint that applies while this repository is private.
  See [Choosing the runner for a job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/choose-the-runner-for-a-job)
  and [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions).
- Larger runners are always charged, including for public repositories. The
  workflows must continue to use standard runner labels unless a paid runner is
  deliberately approved. See [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#free-use-of-github-actions).
- GitHub Free still includes only 500 MB of artifact storage, shared with
  GitHub Packages, and 10 GB of cache storage per repository. Storage is
  measured separately from runner minutes and can accrue charges beyond the
  included amount. See [How storage billing works](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#how-storage-billing-works).
- Free public-repository compute remains subject to GitHub's acceptable-use
  rules. Hosted-runner work must support the repository's production, testing,
  deployment, or publication and must not impose prohibited or disproportionate
  load. See [GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#actions).

## Exposure and History Findings

- A private-to-public conversion makes the code, existing Actions history, and
  Actions logs visible to everyone; anyone can fork the repository. GitHub also
  warns that push rulesets are disabled by the conversion. See
  [Setting repository visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-from-private-to-public).
- GitHub's first response to an exposed password, token, or credential is to
  revoke or rotate it. Rewriting history is secondary and may be unnecessary
  after the credential is invalidated. See
  [Removing sensitive data from a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#about-removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).
- If a history rewrite is necessary, GitHub's process is broader than a force
  push: rewrite locally, update GitHub, coordinate cleanup of other clones, and
  prevent recurrence. Old data can remain in clones, forks, SHA-addressable
  cached views, and pull-request references; GitHub Support may be needed for
  cached views and PR references. A rewrite also changes commit hashes, can
  invalidate signatures and PR diffs, and can be recontaminated by an old clone.
  See [About sensitive data exposure](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#about-sensitive-data-exposure).
- Public-repository secret scanning runs automatically for free and scans the
  full Git history on all branches as well as issues, pull requests,
  discussions, and wikis. Detection depends on supported patterns, so a clean
  result is not proof that no application-specific or unstructured secret is
  present. See [Secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/concepts/secret-security/secret-scanning).
- If an unredacted secret appears in a workflow log, GitHub directs operators to
  delete the log and rotate the secret. See [Secure use reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use#use-secrets-for-sensitive-information)
  and [Using workflow run logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/monitor-workflows/use-workflow-run-logs#deleting-logs).

## Historical Pre-Publication Gate

The checklist below records the gate defined before the visibility switch; it
is not a current go/no-go status. The switch was completed on 2026-09-23, and
the remaining post-publication operator checks are tracked in #732 and #863.

1. Confirm every potentially exposed credential is revoked or rotated; do not
   treat file deletion or history rewriting as credential invalidation.
2. Scan the current tree and every reachable Git ref without printing secret
   values, then review GitHub's secret-scanning alerts after conversion.
3. Audit historical Actions logs and artifacts, plus issues, pull requests,
   discussions, and wikis. Delete affected workflow logs or runs before they
   become public.
4. Decide whether any confirmed exposure warrants a coordinated
   `git-filter-repo` rewrite and GitHub Support cleanup. Do not rewrite history
   merely for cosmetic cleanup.
5. Review every workflow for public-fork safety, keep external-contributor run
   approval enabled, and avoid granting secrets or write tokens to untrusted
   fork code. See [Managing GitHub Actions settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories).
6. After conversion, re-establish branch protection or branch rulesets for
   `main`; both are available for public repositories on GitHub Free. See
   [Managing protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches)
   and [About rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

At the time of this snapshot, the visibility switch was an operator action
after this gate was signed off. It was completed on 2026-09-23 and is not part
of the repository-polish change set.

## Repository Evidence Recorded Through 2026-09-22

- `npm run audit:secrets` scanned all 551 commits reachable from the local refs
  for credential-bearing database URLs, GitHub and AWS credentials, private-key
  headers, and common provider-token formats. It passed with zero unallowlisted
  matches. The command reports only file, line, commit, and category metadata;
  it never prints a matched value.
- Git history contains no tracked `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, key,
  or certificate file. The tracked `.env.example` contains local/example
  fixtures only.
- GitHub reported 2,820 historical workflow runs (as last verified on
  2026-09-22; this count grows with every push and is not a stable
  invariant — treat it as a snapshot, not a target to re-derive) and zero
  retained Actions artifacts. The pull-request, head-commit, and post-merge
  runs associated with #862 had no executed steps because the Actions
  allowance was already exhausted, corroborating #865's assessment that the
  live database credential did not reach GitHub Actions logs through that
  regression.
- A complete review or deliberate retention decision for older workflow logs is
  still required before conversion; the absence of artifacts and the #862
  evidence do not prove every historical log is safe.

The complete point-in-time repository, GitHub, Vercel, production, and local
quality evidence is recorded in the
[2026-09-22 readiness audit](../explanation/audits/2026-09-22-release-public-vercel-readiness.md).

## Vercel and Production Evidence Recorded 2026-09-22

- At the snapshot, the local Vercel project link matched `portfolio`, Node 24,
  and the expected team, but the global CLI (`41.6.1`) had an invalid token
  and the connected Vercel app returned `403` for the team. Deployment, alias,
  environment, quota, and runtime-log state was not verified then; current
  production configuration remains an operator check in #863.
- Release workflows dynamically request `vercel@59.16.0`; the npm registry's
  current stable version was `59.25.0`, and no Vercel CLI is locked in
  `package-lock.json`.
- The last authenticated Vercel capacity snapshot, from 2026-09-12, recorded
  Functions Storage at 96.8% and Build Time at 87%. It was not a current
  reading even at the time of the 2026-09-22 audit; refresh capacity before a
  later production release.
- Public routing works: the apex returns `200`, and `www` returns `308` to the
  apex. The deployed canonical, OpenGraph, robots, sitemap, and structured-data
  output nevertheless still uses `www`.
- Representative production pages return private/no-store cache misses. The
  exact audited `main` build returns prerendered `s-maxage=3600` cache hits.
  Production is behind the intended cache and canonical behavior.
- Production HTML reports Sentry release `dc133b59`, which resolves to a commit
  64 commits behind audited `main` (`7fb7e666`). This is application evidence,
  not an API-confirmed Vercel deployment SHA, because private control-plane
  access was unavailable.
- The ignored `.vercel/.env.production.local` file contains production secret
  material in plaintext on the workstation. It is untracked and does not
  become public with the repository, but it remains sensitive local state and
  is not a valid source for CLI authentication.

## Completed Since Last Verification

- **Application source licensing.** [PR #886](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/pull/886)
  (merged to `main` as `7fb7e666`) added the Apache License 2.0 grant
  (`LICENSE`) and the three-layer `NOTICE` scope statement (application
  source under Apache-2.0, `public/files/` artwork unchanged under CC BY 4.0,
  editorial/identity content all rights reserved), as decided in
  [ADR 0045](../../adr/0045-source-code-licensing-and-three-layer-reuse-boundary.md).
  The licensing surface is enforced by
  `__tests__/public-repository-readiness.test.ts`, which pins the license and
  notice text against truncation or unauthorized mutation rather than
  substring-matching a label. License selection is no longer a publication
  blocker.

## Process Correction: PR #886 Runtime-Impact Declaration

PR #886's Verification checklist checked the Vercel-preview item as "not
requested; no runtime code paths change." That statement was inaccurate: the
merged diff (`7fb7e666`) included runtime-rendered changes — `app/globals.css`,
`app/proof/ProofWorkspaceSkeleton.tsx`, `components/CommandPalette.tsx`,
`components/FooterStatusTicker.tsx`, `components/Hero.tsx`,
`components/MermaidDiagram.tsx`, `components/RichNarrative.tsx`,
`components/UnifiedErrorLayout.tsx`, and `components/arcade/PlayCabinet.tsx`
— and updated a Playwright visual snapshot
(`__tests__/e2e/visual.spec.ts-snapshots/home-chromium-darwin.png`). No
Vercel preview was captured for this diff before merge.

This is recorded here rather than corrected in the PR itself: the PR is
merged and its description is part of the historical record, not something
to rewrite after the fact. The pull request template's runtime-impact
checkbox has been tightened (see `.github/pull_request_template.md`) to
require checking the actual diff for runtime-rendered paths rather than
relying on the author's stated intent, so the same mismatch is harder to
reproduce.

## Historical Go/No-Go Status (2026-09-22 Snapshot)

At the time of this audit, the repository was **not ready to become public or
release to production**. The public-conversion decision has since been made;
the production release still has separate operator and deployment checks.

### Public Conversion

1. Complete [#865](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/865): rotate
   the production database credential, update every dependent environment,
   redeploy, and prove the old credential fails.
2. Resolve the mutation-quality gate. The first functioning local Stryker run
   measured 46.73% against the configured 80% break threshold; the threshold
   has not been weakened.
3. Review or retire all historical Actions runs (2,820 as last verified on
   2026-09-22, and growing) before their logs become public. The absence of
   retained artifacts is not evidence that every log is safe.
4. Finish the public-surface audit of open and closed issues, pull requests,
   discussions, and wikis. Discussions and the wiki are currently disabled;
   that fact does not replace review of existing issue and pull-request text,
   comments, attachments, or linked content.
5. Complete the workflow and repository-setting review for untrusted public
   forks, external-contributor approval, token permissions, and secret access.
   After conversion, enable public secret scanning and restore protection for
   `main` because GitHub disables push rulesets during the visibility change.
6. Pin workflow actions and the Vercel CLI to immutable, reviewed dependency
   identities before accepting untrusted public-fork contributions.

Application source licensing (item 3 in prior verifications) is complete; see
"Completed Since Last Verification" above.

### Production Release (Snapshot: 2026-09-22)

The authoritative release checklist remains
[#863](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/863). In addition to the
credential and mutation gates above, release remains blocked on the unresolved
operator work tracked by:

- [#840](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/840), the historical
  private-repository Actions allowance outage. The repository became public
  on 2026-09-23; check current PR run results instead of treating that closed
  outage as active;
- [#848](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/848), production cron
  secret configuration and a verified scheduled run;
- [#851](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/851), the open
  production credential-path follow-up, whose scope should be reviewed against
  ADR 0049's Vercel-only deployment path;
- [#720](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/720), final production
  canonical and routing verification;
- [#853](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/853), the production
  chunk-cycle warning and regression gate;
- [#817](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/817), production
  performance measurement and remaining global CSS work; and
- [#871](https://github.com/fderuiter/portfolio/issues/871), the operator-owned
  decision on database-backed versus fallback blog content.

The historical Actions-log and public-surface reviews block publication, but
do not independently block a private production deployment. Conversely,
completion of the local repository audit does not close the operator-owned
production checks above.
