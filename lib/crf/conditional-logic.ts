/**
 * Conditional visibility and requiredness runtime for sentence rules (#670).
 *
 * The authoring surface has long been able to declare `show_field`,
 * `hide_field` and `require_field` actions, but nothing applied them when a
 * form was actually filled in: the EDC simulator only ever acted on
 * `raise_query`. This module closes that gap by resolving a form's rules into
 * one explicit per-field state that validation and rendering both read, so the
 * two can never disagree about whether a control is on screen or mandatory.
 *
 * It is deliberately pure. It reads values and returns state, and it never
 * mutates, clears or deletes a field value - a hidden field keeps whatever was
 * captured before it was hidden, and says so through `retainsHiddenValue`.
 *
 * Evaluation reuses the four-valued discrepancy engine from #540 rather than
 * collapsing to a boolean, which is what lets an undecidable rule be reported
 * as undecidable instead of silently behaving like a rule that did not fire.

 *   not be defeated by a broader rule written to reveal it.
 * - Hidden implies not required. A mandatory control the investigator cannot
 *   see would make the form unsubmittable with no way to resolve it, so
 *   requiredness is suppressed while hidden. The authored flag is preserved in
 *   `declaredRequired` and returns intact if the field becomes visible again.
 * - Require is additive. A firing `require_field` can make an optional field
 *   mandatory; nothing in this module makes an authored-required field
 *   optional except being hidden.
 * - Only a `true` result acts. A `false`, `missing` or `incompatible` result
