/**
 * In-builder form test harness (#541).
 *
 * Lets an author exercise the form they are designing without leaving the
 * designer, using the same runtime the EDC simulator uses rather than a
 * parallel approximation: the shared calculation evaluator, the four-valued
 * rule engine, and the conditional visibility runtime. A form that behaves one
 * way in the test dock and another way in the simulator would make the dock
 * worse than useless, so all three are composed here rather than reimplemented.
 *
 * Values are addressed by an explicit subject, visit and field triple, so
 * filling or resetting one visit can never disturb another, and the harness
 * itself is pure - it returns new value maps instead of mutating the one it
 * was handed.
