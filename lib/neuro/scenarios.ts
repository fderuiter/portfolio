    subtitle: "Meningeal dura mater included in brainmask causing artificial pial surface extension.",
    badge: "Meninges Artifact",
    difficulty: "Beginner",
    targetPlane: "coronal",
    targetCoords: { x: 74, y: 46, z: 48 },
    defectDescription:
      "High-intensity rim of dura mater was erroneously included inside brainmask.mgz. The deformable pial surface expands into the non-brain tissue, inflating local cortical thickness estimates by >1.8mm.",
    lore: {
      biologicalCause:
        "Dura mater and arachnoid membranes exhibit T1 signal intensities (~80-90) closely matching adjacent temporal cerebral cortex in 3T MPRAGE acquisitions.",
      algorithmicImpact:
        "The pial surface expansion algorithm (recon-all -autorecon3) seeks the CSF gradient. If dura is preserved in brainmask.mgz, the surface traps non-brain voxels, corrupting biomarker volumes and thickness stats.",
      remediationProtocol:
        "Switch to Coronal orthoview. Select Voxel Erase (B key) with a 2-3 voxel radius. Erase the extra-cerebral dura voxels outside the gray matter border, then click 'Run recon-all' to recalculate.",

    subtitle: "Hypointense WM voxels dropped below 110 threshold, causing white surface holes.",
    badge: "Intensity Defect",
    difficulty: "Intermediate",
    targetPlane: "coronal",
    targetCoords: { x: 28, y: 38, z: 36 },
    defectDescription:
      "B1 transmit field inhomogeneity caused temporal white matter voxel intensities to drop to ~58 (well below the 110 target). The white surface algorithm fails to segment the temporal horn gyral crest.",
    lore: {
      biologicalCause:
        "Dielectric effect and RF coil sensitivity roll-off at 3T/7T cause spatial intensity gradients, particularly in the inferior temporal lobes and cerebellum.",
      algorithmicImpact:
        "FreeSurfer's mri_normalize assumes WM intensity peak is 110. Voxels with intensity < 85 are classified as Gray Matter or CSF, causing white surface retraction and missing gyral white matter.",
      remediationProtocol:
        "Select the Control Point tool (C key). Click inside the hypointense white matter region (intensity ~58) to place a 110 anchor point, or paint wm.mgz voxels directly. Then run 'recon-all -autorecon2-cp'.",
      freeSurferCommand: "recon-all -s sub-01 -autorecon2-cp",

    badge: "Mask Over-Erosion",
    difficulty: "Advanced",
    targetPlane: "sagittal",
    targetCoords: { x: 48, y: 82, z: 52 },
    defectDescription:
      "Aggressive skull-stripping (mri_watershed) clipped 12mm of the superior frontal pole cortical mantle. Surface tessellation cannot form without brainmask restoration.",
    lore: {
      biologicalCause:
        "High skull density and thin CSF buffering in the anterior cranial fossa caused the watershed algorithm to underestimate the true intracranial boundary.",
      algorithmicImpact:
        "Voxels masked out of brainmask.mgz are strictly forbidden from surface tessellation. Any erased cortex results in truncated brain volume and false cortical thinning.",
      remediationProtocol:
        "Switch to Sagittal view. Select Voxel Paint (B key), set intensity to Gray Matter (75-80), and paint the missing frontal gyri back into brainmask.mgz. Run 'recon-all -autorecon2'.",

    badge: "Topology Defect",
    difficulty: "Expert",
    targetPlane: "axial",
    targetCoords: { x: 65, y: 56, z: 68 },
    defectDescription:
      "A narrow white matter voxel bridge crosses the central sulcus, creating a topological handle. Euler characteristic is χ = 0 (1 handle). FreeSurfer requires spherical topology (χ = 2) for cortical sphere inflation.",
    lore: {
      biologicalCause:
        "Partial volume averaging in tight sulcal banks causes opposing gyral white matter boundaries to falsely touch across CSF sulcal fundi.",
      algorithmicImpact:
        "Topological defect invalidates homeomorphy to a 2-sphere ($S^2$). FreeSurfer's mris_fix_topology is forced to apply artificial cutting planes, creating distortion in spherical morphometry.",
      remediationProtocol:
        "Switch to Axial view. Select Voxel Erase (E key). Locate the spurious white matter bridge bridging the sulcus and cut the connection to restore Euler characteristic χ = 2.",

    defectDescription:
      "Full interactive neuroimaging sandbox. Freely navigate 3D cortical surfaces, switch between pial, white matter, inflated, and subcortical models, and slice across Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal orthoviews.",
    lore: {
      biologicalCause: "Clean baseline structural 3T MRI scan without injected artifacts.",
      algorithmicImpact: "Standard FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline output in pristine topological equilibrium.",
      remediationProtocol: "Use all Freeview CAD tools, terminal commands, and 3D surface modes freely.",
      freeSurferCommand: "freeview -v orig.mgz brainmask.mgz wm.mgz -f lh.pial:edgecolor=red lh.white:edgecolor=yellow",
