/**
 * Public entry point for the unified secret-scanning module.

 * pre-commit staged-file guard, and the reachable-history/pickaxe audit),
 * plus the allowlisting, redaction, and fixture data that keep those
 * entrypoints from drifting apart. See `lib/README.md` for the deep-module
 * boundary rules: only this file and `types.ts` are public; `internal/*`
 * is private to this package.
