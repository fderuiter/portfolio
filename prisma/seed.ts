    published: true,
    simulated_telemetry: false,
    tags: "TypeScript, React, Flow, Schemas, AST, Node-RED",
    editorial_content:
      "A **reactive**, `visual graph editor` built in **TypeScript** and **React** that allows system architects to visually compose, validate, and compile complex `JSON Schema` structures in real time. Features highly responsive `node evaluation`, cyclical dependency detection, and live `code generation`.",
    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Modern enterprise APIs often require complex, deeply nested JSON schemas. Hand-authoring these schemas in raw JSON or YAML leads to validation errors, duplicate definitions, and slow developer velocity. Visual graph editors exist, but they suffer from high rendering latency, lacks type-safety, and do not handle recursive schema references gracefully.</p>

<h3>The Architecture</h3>
<p>SchemaFlow is designed around a decoupled three-tier system: the <strong>Graph State Core</strong>, the <strong>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Compiler</strong>, and the <strong>Canvas Render Engine</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
// Graph State Management
interface SchemaNode {
  id: string;
  type: "string" | "number" | "object" | "array" | "ref";
  properties: Record&lt;string, any&gt;;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
}
</code></pre>

<h4>1. Immutable Graph State Core</h4>
<p>The state is modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using a customized Zustand store. Every node represents a schema primitive or block. Connections between nodes represent references (e.g., matching a child field node to a parent object node). To ensure zero UI lagging, state selections are strictly memoized, and computed derived values (like the compiled JSON schema) are debounced and offloaded to a Web Worker.</p>

<h4>2. Cyclical Dependency Detection</h4>
<p>When a developer links nodes, SchemaFlow runs a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm across the active nodes. If a path returns to an ancestor node, a cyclic reference is flagged. Rather than crashing, the compiler safely inserts a <code>$ref</code> definition inside the JSON Schema AST to support recursive definitions (like a folder containing files and other folders) without entering infinite compile loops.</p>

<h4>3. The AST Compiler</h4>
<p>When state is pushed, the compiler resolves node connections into a unified AST. It then generates valid <strong>JSON Schema Draft-07</strong> or <strong>OpenAPI v3</strong> specs. The entire compilation runs in an isolated context, returning a structured output that can be directly copy-pasted or pushed to a schema registry.</p>

      "An enterprise-grade **TypeScript** mapping pipeline that ingests clinical trial metadata in `CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM)` XML format, dynamically constructs `data schemas`, and transforms raw `Electronic Data Capture (EDC)` datasets into compliant **CDISC SDTM** domains.",
    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Clinical trial databases are governed by rigid international regulatory standards set by CDISC. Review bodies like the FDA require trial findings to be submitted as SDTM datasets. The incoming trial data, however, arrives in XML-based CDISC ODM format or proprietary EDC database tables. Manual mapping is error-prone, highly slow, and compromises regulatory compliance.</p>

<h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
<p>The pipeline consists of a streaming XML parser, an intermediary canonical schema engine, and a declarative SDTM compiler.</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">
// Parsing CDISC ODM Metadata structures
interface ODMClinicalData {
  studyOID: string;
  metaDataVersionOID: string;
  subjectData: {
    subjectKey: string;
    studyEventData: {
      studyEventOID: string;
      formData: {
        formOID: string;
        itemGroupData: {
          itemGroupOID: string;
          itemData: { itemOID: string; value: string }[];
        }[];
      }[];
    }[];
  }[];
}
</code></pre>

<h4>1. Streaming XML Parser (ODM Ingestion)</h4>
<p>Clinical metadata XML files can exceed 2GB. Standard DOM parsers exhaust server memory immediately. Our parser uses a Node.js streaming SAX parser (via <code>sax-js</code>) wrapped in TypeScript generators. The pipeline streams XML tags, compiles them into typed OIDs (Object Identifiers), and writes tabular representations directly to SQLite streams, keeping memory usage constant under 50MB.</p>

<h4>2. Dynamic Schema Synthesizer</h4>
<p>ODM files specify exactly what forms were shown, what questions were asked, and what data types were captured (e.g. text, integer, codelist). The Schema Synthesizer reads the ODM <code>MetaDataVersion</code> and dynamically generates validation classes using <code>zod</code>. If the clinical protocol changes (e.g. adding a new adverse event category), the system automatically updates its schema dynamically.</p>

<h4>3. The SDTM Domain Compiler</h4>
<p>Transforms the captured values into structured SDTM domains like **DM (Demographics)**, **AE (Adverse Events)**, or **VS (Vital Signs)**. We implement a declarative mapping language written in TypeScript:
- Matches subject parameters across Study Events.
- Computes standard SDTM columns like <code>AESEV</code> (Adverse Event Severity) and <code>AESTDY</code> (Adverse Event Study Day).
- Validates constraints against CDISC Controlled Terminology vocabularies.</p>

    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Clinical electronic data capture (EDC) systems, such as iMednet, hold highly sensitive patient records and complex clinical trial protocols. Programmatic extraction is required by biostatisticians, data scientists, and clinical engineers for automated reporting and analytical pipelines. However, traditional SOAP/REST endpoints in clinical platforms often lack modern developer ergonomics, proper type safety, and clear schema boundaries, exposing clinical workflows to integration bugs and HIPAA security risks.</p>

<h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
<p>The iMednet Python SDK bridges the gap between raw web APIs and modern scientific computing environments (such as Pandas and Jupyter). It is engineered around three core pillars: <strong>Type-Safe Data Contracts</strong>, <strong>HIPAA-Compliant Transport Layer</strong>, and a <strong>Tabular Compilation Engine</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# Typed SDK API contract using Pydantic
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class SubjectRecord(BaseModel):
    subject_id: str = Field(..., alias="subjectID")
    status: str
    site_id: int = Field(..., alias="siteID")
    enrollment_date: Optional[str] = None
    records_count: int
</code></pre>

<h4>1. Declarative Type-Safe Contracts</h4>
<p>Every response returned by the SDK is validated against strict Pydantic v2 schemas at runtime. This guarantees that clinical data engineers are immediately alerted if the platform schema deviates from expected formats. By utilizing Python's native typing and generic bindings, the SDK offers IDE auto-completion and static analysis checks directly within VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks.</p>

<h4>2. Security-Hardened Transport Layer</h4>
<p>Under the hood, the SDK enforces TLS 1.3 encryption, automatic session token rotation, and localized payload decryption. To comply with HIPAA requirements, sensitive Patient Health Information (PHI) is isolated during transfer, preventing logs or intermediary cache layers from storing decrypted identifiers.</p>

<h4>3. Interactive Developer Sandbox</h4>
<p>To accelerate developer onboarding, the repository introduces an interactive CLI sandbox built directly into the portfolio. Systems engineers can test commands, inspect raw JSON schemas, and simulate error/empty responses in real time, accelerating integration time-to-market from weeks to minutes.</p>

<h3>Executive Summary &amp; Core Architecture</h3>
<p>Cadence Clinical is a multi-tenant digital clinical trial platform that ingests, authors, executes, and exports regulatory-compliant clinical trial lifecycles governed by CDISC USDM, CDASH, SDTM, and ADaM standards. It utilizes a dual-engine polyglot architecture combining graph-native protocol design (Neo4j for CDISC USDM v2/v3 protocol authoring and AST-driven amendment cascading) with a transactional relational engine (PostgreSQL / SQLModel) backed by cryptographic Merkle-tree audit trails and RSA-PSS e-signatures.</p>

<h3>1. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports &amp; Adapters)</h3>
<p>Domain logic across microservices (apps/execution, apps/designer, apps/etmf, apps/safety) is strictly decoupled from framework and infrastructure concerns. Ports define explicit interfaces while adapters handle persistence and external network integration.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Proprietary Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) hardware, such as the InBody 570, encodes comprehensive body composition biometrics into an opaque, high-density query string (<code>IBData</code>) within user-facing QR codes.

<h4>1. Differential Mutation Oracle ("Delta Testing Engine")</h4>
<p>To discover undocumented field boundaries, the engine in <code>inbody-cli/mapping.py</code> systematically isolates contiguous byte slice windows ($w \\in [1..5]$), injects controlled integer perturbations ($\\pm 1$), and evaluates downstream server response variations to programmatically derive offset matrices and floating-point scaling factors.</p>

<h4>2. Seed Normalization &amp; Percent-Encoding Resilience</h4>
<p>A critical bug was resolved where URL percent-encoding (<code>%21</code>) of literal <code>!</code> delimiters caused byte-slice alignment shifts, inducing a $10\\times$ calculation error on Leg Lean Mass. Seed strings are strictly decoded and normalized before delimiter parsing.</p>

<h3>Trade-Offs & Key Decisions</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Exhaustive Permutations ($O(N!)$) vs. Dynamic Programming / Heuristics ($O(N^2 2^N)$)</strong>: Prioritized strict brute-force permutation generation across all targets to maintain an identical baseline for syntactic and runtime execution comparisons across obscure and exotic paradigms.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Subprocess CLI Execution vs. Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</strong>: Chose process-level standard stream (stdout/stderr) assertion over C ABI bindings to accommodate non-standardized runtimes, HDL simulation pipelines (ghdl, iverilog), and legacy/esoteric environments (INTERCAL, COBOL, Modula-2).</p>

Automates large-scale search space exploration over `prime signature lattices` to investigate **quasiperfect numbers** ($\\sigma(n) = 2n + 1$) with zero unproven mathematical axioms.",
    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Investigating the existence of quasiperfect numbers (integers <code>n</code> where the sum of positive divisors <code>σ(n) = 2n + 1</code>) requires searching vast prime exponent lattices. Unverified heuristic search algorithms are fast but vulnerable to arithmetic bugs or missed edge cases. Writing the entire search engine inside a formal theorem prover like Lean 4 introduces massive execution overhead, making exhaustive lattice traversals intractable.</p>

<h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
<p>UALBF utilizes the <strong>Verified Engine Bridge Pattern</strong>, decoupling raw CPU branch-and-bound search from formal mathematical verification. High-throughput search, cyclotomic polynomial evaluation, and bipartite sieve pruning run in Rust (<code>ualbf-project/rust-engine</code>). When obstruction boundaries are encountered, deterministic proof certificates are serialized over C/FFI (<code>lean_ffi.rs</code>) and verified by the lightweight Lean 4 kernel (<code>ualbf-project/lean4-proofs</code>).</p>

<h4>1. Type-Safe Domain Specific Pruning</h4>
<p>The Rust engine implements cyclotomic polynomial factorizations, Euler product evaluators, and Touchard congruence bridges to prune unreachable branches early.

    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>Project Overview &amp; Cultural Impact</h3>
<p>The Laser Loon began as a grassroots design movement during the 2023–2024 Minnesota State Flag redesign initiative (Submission F277). By fusing the serene, natural icon of the Common Loon (<em>Gavia immer</em>) with an over-the-top, retro-futuristic red optical laser beam, the artwork achieved immediate viral status and widespread community adoption. The goal of this project was to formalize the visual concept into a production-grade, highly scalable vector design asset package distributed across every standard graphic production format.</p>

<h3>Design Strategy &amp; Visual Architecture</h3>

<h4>1. Anatomical Accuracy &amp; Stylization</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Iconic Silhouette:</strong> Crafted a clean, recognizable side-profile of the Common Loon floating on calm water, capturing the distinctive bill curve, crested crown, and patterned plumage.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimalist High Contrast:</strong> Used stark black-and-white field blocking to maintain immediate readability at micro-favicons and billboard scales alike.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. The Laser Dynamic</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Focal Convergence:</strong> Engineered the crimson laser beam directly along the eye's sightline, providing directional motion across the composition.</li>
  <li><strong>Beam Illumination:</strong> Designed clean hard-edge vector rays with layered radial glows to ensure high visibility across both light and dark display backdrops.</li>

<h3>1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Official proprietary speaker management applications often introduce heavy resource overhead, vendor lock-in, cloud dependencies, and sluggish user interfaces. This repository provides a lightweight, local-network control plane and REST API for Sonos smart speakers, bypassing external cloud intermediaries in favor of direct local network orchestration.</p>
<p><strong>Core Technical Highlight:</strong> Engineered a non-blocking, asynchronous UPnP/SOAP protocol client stack using aiohttp and asyncio, backed by an extensible registry pattern and dynamic XML schema parsing (handling complex nested XML, DIDL-Lite metadata, and UPnP SOAP faults) to manage multi-room audio, topology sync, and real-time state manipulation.</p>

<h3>2. Architecture & Patterns</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Layered Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):</strong> Segregates lower-level SOAP transport primitives (<code>BaseSonosClient</code>) from domain-specific UPnP services (<code>AVTransportClient</code>, <code>RenderingControlClient</code>, <code>ZoneGroupTopologyClient</code>) and business domain orchestration services (<code>RadioService</code>, <code>SonosZoneService</code>, <code>AlarmService</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>Command / Registry Pattern:</strong> Centralized dispatch via <code>ACTION_REGISTRY</code> mapping string commands directly to asynchronous lambdas and service methods, eliminating verbose endpoint routing trees.</li>
  <li><strong>Hypermedia-Driven Single Page Architecture (HDA):</strong> HTMX-powered frontend integration with server-rendered Jinja2 HTML fragments, achieving dynamic UI reactivity without the bundle size and state synchronization overhead of heavy JavaScript frameworks.</li>

<p><strong>Provider & Factory Patterns:</strong> Simulation engines implement pluggable interfaces (<code>clintrials/core/protocol.py</code>, <code>clintrials/core/unified.py</code>, <code>factory.py</code>) decoupling simulation definitions, recruitment geometry modeling, and rendering targets (Jupyter notebooks, CLI runners, and Pyodide web dashboards).</p>
<p><strong>State Machine & Solvers:</strong> Trial progression and patient accrual are driven by explicit deterministic state management (<code>recruitment_state.py</code>, <code>recruitment_solver.py</code>, <code>cohort.py</code>).</p>

<h3>1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition</h3>
<p><strong>Problem Solved:</strong> Clinical trial randomization and schema definition often rely on proprietary, closed statistical software or unverified ad-hoc scripts. This lack of transparency introduces audit vulnerabilities, non-reproducible patient treatment allocations, and severe regulatory compliance overhead under GxP and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero-Latency In-Browser Transpilation:</strong> Sub-10ms generation of CDISC ADaM-lite compliant trial schemas and statistical companion programs across 4 major analytical languages.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero-Data-Exfiltration Compliance:</strong> 100% client-side Web Worker execution ensuring zero Protected Health Information (PHI) leaves the local browser context.</li>
  <li><strong>Deterministic Bitwise Audit:</strong> End-to-end auditability validated via automated golden test suites and cross-environment execution checks across all statistical targets.</li>

<p><strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Hexagonal Architecture:</strong> Clear decoupling of core domain algorithms (<code>randomization-engine</code>, <code>minimization-algorithm</code>, <code>fisher-yates</code>, <code>largest-remainder</code>) from presentation layers and platform export strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Signal-Based Reactive State Management:</strong> Fine-grained Angular signals state layer (<code>study-builder.store.ts</code>, <code>signal-forms.ts</code>, <code>signal-router.service.ts</code>) managing multi-step clinical schema authoring without external heavy state libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate Representation (IR) Compiler Pattern:</strong> Centralized intermediate representation (<code>ir.model.ts</code>, <code>transpiler.ts</code>) driving multi-target code emission (<code>python.strategy.ts</code>, <code>r.strategy.ts</code>, <code>sas.strategy.ts</code>, <code>stata.strategy.ts</code>) and AST validation (<code>ast-validator.ts</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Off-Main-Thread Processing:</strong> Web Worker isolation (<code>randomization-engine.worker.ts</code>, <code>worker-protocol.ts</code>) executing computationally heavy Monte Carlo simulations and large-stratum randomization permutations without degrading UI frame rates.</p>

<h3>5. Trade-Offs, Edge Cases & Decisions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-Side Execution vs. Backend API:</strong> Avoided a traditional backend API architecture to achieve intrinsic zero-trust compliance (HIPAA/GxP); all data generation, hashing, and validation reside entirely in browser sandbox memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Lightweight AST/IR vs. Heavyweight AST Parsers:</strong> Built a targeted IR domain generator optimized for statistical generation scripts (Python, R, SAS, Stata) rather than relying on bloated language parser dependencies, resulting in minimal bundle overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Isolated MT19937 PRNG Implementation vs. Native crypto.getRandomValues:</strong> Engineered custom seedable MT19937 runtime implementations to enforce cross-platform mathematical reproducibility across Stata, SAS, and R engines, backed by cryptographic SHA-256 integrity checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Language PRNG Alignment:</strong> Bridged discrepancies between 0-indexed and 1-indexed statistical runtime seeds and uniform distribution implementations across R, Python, and SAS macros through unified golden fixture validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Stratification Remainder Drift:</strong> Solved fractional allocation imbalances in multi-strata designs by implementing the Largest Remainder Method and Pocock-Simon covariate adaptive minimization.</li>
  <li><strong>Offline Auditing & Traceability:</strong> Automated generation of the Requirements Traceability Matrix directly integrated with verification test suites.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Lessons Learned & Future Roadmap</h3>
<p><strong>Refactoring opportunity:</strong> Extending intermediate representation to support WebAssembly-compiled C engines for real-time permutation runs exceeding $10^6$ iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Future roadmap:</strong> Adding FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data export integration and automated validation protocol report generation for electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) submissions.</p>

    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Modern cloud-native container workloads require configuring deeply nested, multi-tenant YAML manifests encompassing resource quotas, ingress rules, secret mounts, health probes, and sidecar proxies. Hand-crafting these specifications leads to syntax errors, schema drift across cluster releases, and deployment outages. Traditional form builders either hardcode static form schemas (unmaintainable across fast-moving container definitions) or use naive dynamic form libraries that suffer from main-thread re-render thrashing during 50KB+ manifest AST resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Core Technical Highlight:</strong> DuckDeploy dynamically ingests JSON Schema Draft-07 and Draft 2020-12 specifications, compiles structural types into a normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and synthesizes polymorphic form state. Manifest generation for Kubernetes, Helm values, and Knative Cloud Run specs is entirely offloaded to background Web Workers, maintaining strict sub-4ms keystroke input latency on 100+ field dynamic forms.</p>

<h3>2. Architecture & Design Patterns</h3>
<p><strong>AST-Driven Dynamic UI Synthesis:</strong> Parses complex JSON Schema constructs (<code>oneOf</code>, <code>anyOf</code>, <code>$ref</code>, <code>patternProperties</code>) into an intermediate UI node tree (<code>SchemaNode</code>), mapping structural primitives to specialized, accessible input components.</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphic Discriminated Union Store:</strong> Utilizes a Zustand-backed normalized state store that isolates inactive polymorphic union branches, preventing stale input parameters from leaking into compiled output manifests.</p>
<p><strong>Off-Main-Thread Web Worker Compilation Pipeline:</strong> An isolated Web Worker execution sandbox (<code>manifest.worker.ts</code>) processes AST normalization, Zod constraint validation, and multi-format YAML generation without degrading React 19 rendering frame rates.</p>

<h3>4. Critical Invariants, Edge Cases & Defect Remediations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cyclic Dependency Resolution:</strong> Recursive <code>$ref</code> pointers are resolved with depth-bounded pointer caching (depth limit = 16), safely halting cyclic loops while preserving schema expressiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Polymorphic State Isolation:</strong> When switching between union alternatives (e.g., switching from Dockerfile build to Prebuilt Image Registry), inactive sub-tree fields are quarantined in a staging snapshot to prevent ghost fields from emitting into output YAML.</li>
  <li><strong>Sub-4ms Keystroke Latency:</strong> Multi-target manifest generation is debounced with a 150ms worker dispatch queue, isolating heavy YAML serializations from the browser's 60fps main UI event loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Lessons Learned & Architectural Trade-Offs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client-Side Worker Compilation vs. Remote REST API:</strong> Compiling manifests client-side eliminated server roundtrips, reducing preview update latency from 450ms to 2.4ms and allowing full offline manifest authoring.</li>

<h3>1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of global mortality. While Electronic Health Record (EHR) registries (e.g. NHANES, UK Biobank, Framingham) provide rich longitudinal biomarker measurements, developing robust machine learning models for 10-year Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) is fraught with covariate drift across health systems, subtle target leakage, and skewed probability calibration. Standard pipelines that fit transformers across full datasets report inflated validation scores that fail catastrophically in clinical practice.</p>
<p><strong>Core Technical Highlight:</strong> Engineered an end-to-end clinical tabular ML pipeline in Python implementing leak-free Stratified Out-of-Fold (OOF) cross-validation. Employs adversarial validation to preemptively diagnose covariate shifts, ensembles tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost), and uses Isotonic Regression to minimize Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 2.5% with TreeSHAP patient-level risk attribution.</p>

<h3>2. Architecture & Design Patterns</h3>
<p><strong>Adversarial Validation Subsystem:</strong> Trains a domain-classifier to discriminate training vs external test cohort distributions (AUC &lt; 0.55 validation gate), automatically flagging biomarker shift before model training.</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulated In-Fold Preprocessing:</strong> Custom Scikit-Learn transformers (MICE iterative missingness imputation, categorical weight-of-evidence encoding, winsorization) fit strictly on train folds and purely transform out-of-fold validation sets.</p>
<p><strong>Ensemble Model Architecture &amp; Isotonic Calibration:</strong> Rank-averages predictions from LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, followed by Isotonic Regression and Platt scaling to provide well-calibrated probabilistic risk scores suitable for clinical triage.</p>
<p><strong>Explainable Clinical AI via TreeSHAP:</strong> Decomposes individual patient log-odds into transparent biomarker risk contributions (systolic BP, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, smoking pack-years).</p>

<h3>4. Critical Invariants, Edge Cases & Defect Remediations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Zero Unsafe Dynamic Execution:</strong> All formulas are processed by the recursive descent AST tokenizer, strictly eliminating <code>eval()</code> and <code>Function()</code> constructors.</li>
  <li><strong>Division-by-Zero &amp; Boundary Trapping:</strong> Formula evaluations return typed result envelopes with structured diagnostic codes, preventing unhandled runtime exceptions during data entry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Lessons Learned & Architectural Trade-Offs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lightweight AST vs. Heavy Math Engines:</strong> Implementing a custom 300-line AST parser eliminated 120KB of dependencies and enabled strict validation compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 audit requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Deterministic SHA-256 State Hashing:</strong> Hashing form definitions and formula expressions allowed immediate detection of specification drift between protocol versions.</li>

      "A robust **LLM prompt orchestration and automated evaluation framework** built in **TypeScript**. Treats prompts as immutable, version-controlled software assets with strict **semantic versioning (SemVer)**, deterministic **Zod schema output validation**, and automated **CI/CD regression evaluation pipelines** protecting against semantic drift and hallucination.",
    architectural_narrative: `
<h3>1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition</h3>
<p>Production LLM applications frequently encounter non-deterministic outputs, prompt regressions across foundation model upgrades, malformed JSON responses that break API contracts, and a lack of reproducible versioning. Engineering teams need a disciplined framework that treats prompts like code—complete with typed parameters, automated regression suites, and release gates.</p>
<p><strong>Core Technical Highlight:</strong> PromptOps introduces an immutable prompt orchestration framework in TypeScript with semantic SemVer releases, Zod output schema enforcement with automatic JSON repair, multi-provider failover routing, and automated CI/CD golden eval regression test suites.</p>

<h3>2. Architecture & Design Patterns</h3>
<p><strong>Prompt as Code &amp; SemVer Registry:</strong> Models prompt templates with typed input/output variables, storing versions with semantic SemVer tags (major: schema contract change, minor: prompt engineering optimization, patch: parameter/temperature tuning).</p>
<p><strong>Structured Output Assertion &amp; JSON Repair:</strong> Enforces strict Zod schema validation on model outputs, with automated markdown stripping and bracket repair for multi-provider API responses (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama).</p>
<p><strong>Automated CI/CD Evaluation Pipeline:</strong> Executes regression test suites against prompt releases on golden datasets, computing LLM-as-a-Judge semantic similarity, exact match rates, token costs, and latency metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Provider Failover Router:</strong> Implements circuit breakers and intelligent retry routing across primary and secondary model endpoints.</p>
